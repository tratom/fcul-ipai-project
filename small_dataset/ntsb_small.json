During the subsequent landing attempt at his home airport, the nose landing gear collapsed, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage. An examination of the airplane revealed that the nose wheel and nose wheel attach bracket had broken free from the rest of the nose landing gear, and these items were recovered from the aborted landing airport. Following the accident, the pilot reported that he believed that a no-flap landing may prevented the bounced landing. In an interview with the pilot after the accident flight, the pilot also reported that he performed a preflight inspection of the nose landing gear and that he found no mechanical failures or anomalies, and that the nose gear operated normally during taxi and takeoff for the accident flight. Based on this information, it is likely that the pilot’s improper recovery from the bounced landing resulted in damage that ultimately led to the failure of the nose landing gear during the subsequent landing.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On December 31, 2023, at 1213 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-46R-350T, N539MA, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Mooresville, North Carolina. The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nA family member reported that the pilot was taking the airplane for a short flight then refueling it in advance of a family trip planned for the following day. According to preliminary Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data, the airplane departed from runway 32 at Lake Norman Airpark (14A), Mooresville, North Carolina, about 1152 and climbed to an altitude of about 3,000 ft mean sea level (msl) on a northwesterly ground track following the Catawba River for about 30 nautical miles (nm). At 1202 the pilot made a left turn and flew a direct course back toward 14A. ADS-B information revealed the ground speed was about 200 kts for the entire flight until about 1210, when there was a notable decrease in ground speed and the beginning of a descent. Another pilot in the traffic pattern at 14A reported that the accident pilot reported a two-mile final approach to runway 14 at 14A on the common traffic advisory frequency and did not mention any problems at that time. The airplane’s last ADS-B position was recorded at 1213. It showed that the airplane was at an altitude of 850 ft msl (or about 60 feet above ground level), and about 488 ft northwest of the accident site (about 3/4 nm from the threshold of runway 14). &#x0D;\nAccording to a witness located near the accident site, no engine noise could be heard prior to the impact. This statement was consistent with the review of several residential surveillance video recordings of the airplane’s final descent, which all contained no engine noise.&#x0D;\nReview of the airplane’s maintenance logbooks revealed that the engine had accrued 47.6 hours of operation since overhaul by the manufacturer on July 14, 2023.&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that the airplane came to rest upright about 58 ft southeast of a severed treetop that was broken about 40 ft above the ground. A ground scar about 18 ft in length and oriented to 159° true led up to the airplane. Several trees displayed impact damage and fallen branches were in the debris path. There was no evidence of fire, and all major components of the airplane were recovered in the immediate vicinity of the airplane. &#x0D;\nThe fuselage, right wing, and most of the empennage remained intact. A portion of the upper fuselage and windscreen of the cockpit was cut to facilitate recovery of the pilot. The left wing was fractured and resting inverted on top of the right wing. The left horizontal stabilizer (minus the elevator) was located in front of the cockpit, and the left elevator remained in a tree. The right wing remained attached by the aft wing attachment. Both main wing spars were fractured at the respective wing root, and both wings exhibited damage consistent with tree impact. The flaps and landing gear were retracted. Both the left and right wing fuel tanks contained a liquid consistent in smell and color with 100LL aviation fuel. The engine remained attached to the fuselage at the engine mount. Two of the three composite propeller blades were detached at the blade roots. The blade that remained attached to the propeller hub displayed chordwise tears. One of the detached blades was fractured. None of the blades displayed chordwise abrasion, twisting or bending, nor was any leading edge damage observed.  &#x0D;\nThe throttle, propeller, and mixture levers were in their full forward positions. The fuel selector handle was positioned to the left tank. The emergency fuel pump switch was in the ON position. Flight control cable continuity was confirmed from the cockpit area to each of the respective control surfaces through separations consistent with accident forces. &#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed continuity of the crankshaft to the rear accessory gears and to the valve train. Thumb compression and suction were observed from all cylinders when the crankshaft was rotated. The left and right magnetos were removed, and sparks were observed on all towers when each magneto's input driveshaft was rotated with an electric drill. Examination of the engine’s cylinders with a lighted borescope revealed no anomalies. The top sparkplugs were removed and showed signs of heavy carbon deposits. The engine driven fuel pump was removed and did not contain any fuel. Its input drive rotated freely by hand and flowed fuel when tested with an electric drill. The emergency fuel boost pump was removed and operated when electrical power was applied. Air was applied and flowed throughout the fuel lines. When the fuel flow divider was removed and disassembled, a small amount of fluid consistent with 100LL aviation fuel was found in the flow divider. No contamination was noted, and the diaphragm was in good condition. The fuel servo was intact and undamaged. Upon removal, fluid consistent with 100LL aviation fuel was observed coming from the inlet to the servo fitting and from the fuel pressure sensor fitting. The throttle plate moved appropriately when the throttle arm was actuated. &#x0D;\nThe fuel servo screen was removed and inspected, with no contamination noted. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was retained for further examination.",

Prior to the accident flight, which departed from a hard-surface runway, he serviced the airplane with fuel and performed a preflight check. He intended to perform water landings on an adjacent lake, and after takeoff he selected the gear-up switch but had forgotten to reset the circuit breakers. &#x0D;\nShortly after takeoff he felt a light airframe vibration and decided to expedite the landing. While circling the landing spot, and slowing the airplane for the approach, the gear misconfigured warning sounded. However, the pilot silenced the warning because his attention was diverted by the landing due to the vibration, so the gear remained extended as the airplane touched the water. The airplane then nosed over and sustained substantial damage.&#x0D;\nThe “before engine start” checklist in the pilot’s operating handbook states that the circuit breakers should be in. There is no reference in the handbook to pulling the circuit breakers to prevent accidental activation.",

    "FactualNarrative": "On December 23, 2023, about 1000 Hawaii-Aleutian standard time, a Cessna 172P, N53725, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Kahului Airport (PHOG), Kahului, Hawaii. The pilot and two passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that, after five touch-and-go landings, while on the base leg of the traffic pattern, the engine lost partial power. The pilot applied carburetor heat, switched the fuel tanks, and pumped the throttle, but engine power remained at idle. Unable to reach the runway, the pilot performed a forced landing short of the runway. Upon touchdown, the airplane nosed over and came to rest inverted, which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage and empennage. About 20 gallons of automotive fuel remained in the fuel tanks at the accident site.&#x0D;\nA postaccident engine examination revealed the presence of fuel in the strainer and carburetor bowl. The fuel was drained from the strainer and carburetor bowl, and a trace amount of water was found. Continuity was established on all linkages to the carburetor and airbox; all linkages functioned normally, and the butterfly valves were found to operate normally. The spark plugs were removed and the plug electrodes appeared normal. The magnetos produced spark on all ignition leads. The airplane was started normally and accelerated smoothly from idle to 1,700 rpm with no anomalies noted. &#x0D;\nA review of the local meteorological data and the Carburetor Icing Probability Chart located in the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin CE-09-35, Carburetor Icing Prevention, dated June 30, 2009, revealed that the weather conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to serious icing at glide power.&#x0D;\nFAA Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (CE-09-35) – Carburetor Icing Prevention, stated that: “…pilots should be aware that carburetor icing doesn't just occur in freezing conditions, it can occur at temperatures well above freezing temperatures when there is visible moisture or high humidity. Icing can occur in the carburetor at temperatures above freezing because vaporization of fuel, combined with the expansion of air as it flows through the carburetor, (Venturi Effect) causes sudden cooling, sometimes by a significant amount within a fraction of a second. Carburetor ice can be detected by a drop in rpm in fixed pitch propeller airplanes and a drop in manifold pressure in constant speed propeller airplanes. In both types, usually there will be a roughness in engine operation.”&#x0D;\nAccording to Transport Canada TP 10737 (Use of Automotive Gasoline [Mogas] in Aviation), Mogas is generally higher in volatility than Avgas and will thus absorb more heat from the mixing air when vaporizing, resulting in ice accumulation at higher ambient temperatures. It goes on to say that “the likelihood of carb icing while flying on Mogas is higher,” and advises that, “[a]lthough the severity of the carb icing and the methods to deal with it are similar for both Avgas and Mogas, its ONSET is likely to occur at HIGHER AMBIENT TEMPERATURES and at LOWER HUMIDITY with Mogas. In other words, conditions under which a pilot may feel there is only a slight risk for carb icing on Avgas may in fact be ideal for the formation of ice while using more volatile Mogas. This will result in the need to select ‘carb heat on’ in less severe icing conditions and for a longer duration while using Mogas.” -",

The airplane subsequently nosed over and came to rest inverted, resulting in substantial damage to the vertical stabilizer and rudder. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot thought that the NOTAM of the airport closure had expired. It was determined that the airport was meant to be temporarily closed, but the applicable NOTAM was inadvertently allowed to expire and was not renewed. Appropriate mitigations have since been incorporated to prevent recurrence.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot departed for a local flight shortly before the accident occurred. Recorded data showed that about 10 minutes into the flight, while about 3,000 ft mean sea level, groundspeed began to slow considerably, which was followed by a descent towards a large lake. The flight track continued over the lake and the loss of groundspeed and altitude also continued. A witness located near the accident site observed the airplane flying low over the water and then enter a right bank towards a tree line along the shoreline. The witnesses did not recall hearing any engine sounds. The airplane impacted the trees, then abruptly descended and impacted a parking lot. The airplane exploded on impact, and a large fire developed around the entire airplane. A distant surveillance camera captured the final moments of flight, which showed the airplane in a flight path consistent with the witness reports. &#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures. Extensive thermal damage prevented the investigation from fully evaluating the airplane’s fuel system. About 10 gallons of fuel was recovered from the right main fuel tank. The other tanks were breached, destroyed, or empty of fuel. The fuel selector was not recovered. The thermal damage also prevented the recovery of any non-volatile memory stored in the cockpit primary and multi-function displays.&#x0D;\nBased on the available evidence, it is likely that the airplane’s engine lost power; however, here was no evidence that the engine experienced a catastrophic mechanical failure and there was sufficient fuel on-board. Due to the thermal damage sustained to the airplane, the reason for the loss of power could not be determined. &#x0D;\nThe pilot’s severe coronary artery disease placed him at increased risk of a distracting, distressing, impairing, or incapacitating cardiovascular event, such as angina, arrhythmia, or heart attack. There is no autopsy evidence that such an event occurred, but such an event does not leave reliable autopsy evidence if it occurs just before death. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the pilot’s severe coronary artery disease contributed to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostimpact fire provides a plausible explanation for the pilot’s carboxyhemoglobin result, particularly considering the possibility of some passive carbon monoxide absorption into cavity blood after death. The cyanide level in the pilot’s cavity blood likely was due to exposure to fire smoke, and was not likely due to engine exhaust exposure, because cyanide typically is produced by combustion of nitrogen-containing polymers. Overall, available postmortem evidence provides no clear indication that preimpact carbon monoxide or cyanide poisoning occurred, that in-flight fire occurred, or that the pilot breathed during the known fire.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to maintenance records and Continental Motors factory records, the engine was factory assembled and packed on March 20, 2023, and installed on the airplane May 1, 2023. &#x0D;\nThe most recent annual inspection was completed on May 1, 2023. The last maintenance entry in the engine logbook was on September 26, 2023, with an engine total time of 55.4 and an airplane Hobbs total time of 1,602. This maintenance inspection was for an oil change, which was performed by the accident pilot. The filter was also checked for contaminants, with none observed.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot’s operating handbook (POH), the airplane was equipped with two main wing fuel tanks that contained 37 gallons of usable fuel per tank. A visual measuring tab was attached to each filler neck of each individual cell. The bottom of the tab indicated 27 gallons of usable fuel in the cell, and the detent slot on the tab indicated 32 gallons of usable fuel in the cell. The engine-driven fuel injector pump delivers approximately 10 gallons of excess fuel per hour, which bypasses the fuel control and returns it to the cell being used.&#x0D;\nFuel quantity is measured by float-operated fuel level sensors located in each wing tank system. These sensors transmit electrical signals to the engine and airframe interface to generate the left and right usable fuel quantity displayed in the engine and systems display portion of the MFD (Multi-Function Display).&#x0D;\nThe fuel selector valve handle was located forward and to the left of the pilot’s seat. Takeoffs and landings must be made using the tank that is nearest full.&#x0D;\nThe POH cautioned pilots to observe that the long, pointed end of the handle aligns with the fuel tank position being selected.&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA Airworthiness records, on April 19, 2010, the airplane was equipped with J.L. Osbourne tip tanks. They were installed in accordance with FAA supplemental type certificate STC SA4-1629. &#x0D;\nThe airplane flight manual supplement detailed that the two tip tanks could contain 20 gallons of fuel to be transferred to the main fuel tanks. The tanks were to be loaded symmetrically. The normal procedures section stated that fuel could be transferred in level flight at approximately 25 gallons per hour per tank. The amount of fuel transferred to the main tanks should only occur once sufficient fuel was consumed from the main tanks. The cockpit contained a switch to start and stop the fuel transfer pumps.&#x0D;\nThe POH’s provided the following emergency procedures:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3: Emergency Airspeeds. - On December 21, 2023, about 1714 eastern standard time, a Hawker Beechcraft Corp. G36 airplane, N23VS, was destroyed when it impacted terrain near Buford, Georgia. The private pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot’s family, the airplane was based at Dekalb-Peachtree Airport (PDK), Atlanta, Georgia, and the purpose of flight was to perform a local flight in the area.&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA ADS-B data, the airplane departed PDK at 1701 and navigated north, cruising at 3,000 ft mean sea level (msl). About 5 minutes into the flight, the flight track turned northeast toward Lake Lanier, Georgia, and the airplane continued to maintain 3,000 ft msl and about 160-170 knots groundspeed.&#x0D;\nAt 1712:32, the flight track turned east and the airplane continued to maintain 3,000 ft msl, but groundspeed slowed to 98 knots. Subsequently, groundspeed and altitude began to decrease, and the flight track continued east over Lake Lanier.&#x0D;\nAt 1714:19, the final position recorded was .1 mile north of the accident site. The airplane was about 100 ft above ground level, had turned to the right (south), and groundspeed was 70 knots. Figures 1 and 2 provide an overview of the final few minutes of the ADS-B flight track.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Overview of the ADS-B flight track for the final few minutes of flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: Closer view of the ADS-B flight track for the final minute of flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness near the accident site observed the airplane flying low over the water from west to east. He observed the airplane enter a right bank towards a tree line along the shoreline. The airplane subsequently impacted the trees, then abruptly descended and impacted a parking lot. Simultaneously with the impact, the airplane exploded, and a large fire developed around the entire airplane. Another witness near the accident site heard the airplane’s impact with trees. Neither witness heard the sound of an airplane engine.&#x0D;\nA distant surveillance camera captured the final moments of flight, and showed the airplane in a flight path consistent with the witness reports. The airplane’s position/ landing lights were on, the airplane was descending in a right bank, and subsequently exited the camera view. Immediately after exiting the camera view, an explosion was observed.&#x0D;\nNumerous fixed-base operators were requested to provide fuel receipts or fuel records for the accident airplane; however, no records were located for any recent time preceding the accident. - According to the autopsy, conducted by Forensic Medicine Associates Inc., at the DeKalb County Forensic Science Center, Decatur, Georgia, the pilot’s cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries, with additional thermal injuries, and the manner of death was an accident. Evidence of atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease was identified, including plaque causing 75-99% narrowing of the right coronary artery, 50% narrowing of the left main coronary artery, 50% narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and 30% narrowing of the left circumflex coronary artery. Visual examination of the heart muscle did not identify other significant natural disease, although thermal injury was present.&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory, detected Carboxyhemoglobin at 10% and cyanide (1.46 ug/ml). The testing was also positive for losartan, and atorvastatin. The testing was negative for ethanol. &#x0D;\nCarboxyhemoglobin is formed when carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in blood, diminishing the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to body tissues. Carbon monoxide is an odorless, tasteless, colorless, nonirritating gas that can be produced during hydrocarbon combustion. Exposure to carbon monoxide usually occurs by inhalation of smoke or exhaust fumes. Symptoms of low-level carbon monoxide exposure are nonspecific and variable, and may include headache, nausea, and tiredness. Increasing levels of exposure may become impairing or incapacitating, causing more serious neurocognitive, cardiac, and/or vision problems, progressing to death above carboxyhemoglobin levels of about 50% (or lower if other serious medical conditions co-exist), although symptoms are not simply predictable from carboxyhemoglobin levels.&#x0D;\nCyanide is a fast-acting poison that interferes with cells’ ability to use oxygen. Cyanide may be produced as a byproduct of the combustion of nitrogen-containing polymers, which are found in a variety of goods including some plastics, upholstery materials, and synthetic rubbers. Cyanide exposure frequently occurs by inhalation during fires in which such goods are burning. Notably, the cyanide level can increase in pooled cavity blood that is passively exposed to atmospheric cyanide from fire after a person’s death. To a lesser extent, the carboxyhemoglobin level also can increase slightly in pooled cavity blood passively exposed to carbon monoxide from fire.&#x0D;\nLosartan is a prescription medication commonly used to treat high blood pressure. Atorvastatin is a prescription medication commonly used to control cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular risk. Losartan and atorvastatin are not generally considered impairing. - The airplane impacted a line of trees along the Lake Lanier shoreline. A ground scar was located about 50 ft from the initial impact with trees. The wreckage debris path was oriented on a 220° magnetic heading and was about 110 ft in length. Figure 3 shows the accident site and the witness-described flight path.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3: Aerial image of the accident site annotated with the witness-described flight path (red line). Image courtesy Hall County Sheriff’s Office.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll major portions of the airframe were located in one compact area. The airframe sustained severe thermal damage; however, the engine sustained limited thermal damage. Flight control continuity was established from all primary flight control surfaces to the cockpit except for separations consistent with impact forces or thermal damage.&#x0D;\nThe cockpit sustained severe thermal damage and all switches, levers, and flight instruments were thermal- or impact-damaged. The Garmin G1000 sustained severe thermal damage, preventing recovery of any non-volatile memory.&#x0D;\nThe flap actuators were consistent with a retracted flap position. The landing gear was found retracted.&#x0D;\nThe majority of the fuel system was not observed due to severe thermal damage. Fragments of fuel system plumbing were found thermally damaged throughout the wreckage. The left wing main tank was ruptured and consumed by fire and the left tip tank separated from the wing, ruptured, and was empty of fuel. The right wing main tank was found breached, but still containing fuel. About 10 gallons of fuel were recovered from the right main tank. The right tip tank remained attached to the wing and was found empty of fuel. &#x0D;\nThe fuel selector valve was not observed in the wreckage. The fuel strainer screen normally housed in the fuel selector was found loose in the wreckage with thermal damage. The fuel hoses forward of the firewall exhibited thermal damage.&#x0D;\nThe firewall largely protected the engine from severe thermal damage. The No. 6 cylinder rocker cover was cracked, consistent with impact damage. There was no other major external damage noted to the engine.&#x0D;\nEngine examination and teardown revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nThe propeller flange and hub had separated from the engine and were located in the debris path. All three propeller blades remained attached to the hub. One blade exhibited s-bending, tip curling, and chordwise scratching. A second blade exhibited tip curling and chordwise scratching. The third blade remained relatively straight and contained a lesser amount of chordwise scratching. -",

The pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, he and a passenger departed Spanish Fork Municipal Airport (SPK) for a flight around the area. While about five miles west of SPK, at an altitude of about 10,500 ft mean sea level (msl), they heard a loud sound and saw something depart through the top of the engine cowling.  The engine began to run rough along with smoke emanating from the engine area. The pilot noticed that the oil pressure had dropped to zero and the audible oil pressure alarm had activated. &#x0D;\nThe pilot turned the fuel selector valve to OFF, pulled the mixture to idle cutoff, and opened the window as they made an emergency descent. He stated that during the descent, sparks and pieces of metal were coming out of the cowling. He added that there was a significant amount of smoke in the cockpit, and that it began to clear as he continued his decent towards SPK. The pilot configured the airplane for landing, and upon touchdown on runway 12, the nosewheel collapsed.  Once the airplane came to rest, it erupted in flames which resulted in substantial damage to the fuselage. &#x0D;\nThe airplane was recovered to a secure location for further examination.",

Investigative groups led by the NTSB were formed in the areas of operational factors, powerplants, systems, medical, and digital flight data recorder (DFDR).&#x0D;\nHistory of Flight&#x0D;\nThe captain was the pilot flying for the incident flight, and the first officer (FO) was the pilot monitoring. The flight crew reported that, after an uneventful takeoff and while climbing through about 1,000 ft, the FO heard the captain say “bird,” which was followed immediately by a “thump” on the left side of the airplane. The airplane began to “shake violently with a distinct loss of thrust” in the left (No. 1) engine. The left engine master caution fire warning light and the engine fire switch illuminated, and the fire bell sounded. &#x0D;\nThe captain called for Engine Fire or Engine Severe Damage checklist on the Quick Reference Card. After the FO started the checklist, the flight deck began to fill with “acrid white smoke.” The FO stated that he could not clearly see the captain. The FO called out “masks,” the pilots donned their masks, and performance of the checklist resumed. &#x0D;\nThe flight crew declared an emergency to air traffic control and asked airport rescue and firefighting (ARFF) to roll the trucks in preparation for the airplane’s return to MSY. The captain stated that visibility in the cockpit was restricted and that he could see nothing beyond the FO, who was holding the Quick Reference Handbook. The captain also stated that his instrument panel was difficult to see and that he thought he might need to fly the airplane by solely using the heads-up guidance system. The captain further stated that, after the engine fire switch had been pulled, the smoke began to rapidly dissipate. &#x0D;\nThe flight crew notified the flight attendants about the emergency and made a public address announcement to notify the passengers that fire trucks would be meeting the airplane. After landing at the airport, the airplane came to a full stop on the arrival runway, and ARFF inspected the airplane before the flight crew taxied the airplane to the assigned gate under its own power. The passengers deplaned normally, and no injuries were reported. &#x0D;\nFlight Data Recorder Data &#x0D;\nData from the airplane’s DFDR was sent to the NTSB’s Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for analysis. A preliminary review of the data has been completed, and a graph with the incident flight parameters is shown in figure 1. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. FDR data from the accident landing.  &#x0D;\nThe data showed that, after takeoff, while the airplane was climbing through about 600 ft, both the left and right engine fan speed (N1) values were about 83 percent rpm. About 2 seconds later, the left engine’s N1 decreased to 75 percent rpm. Subsequently, the airborne vibration monitor (AVM) began to increase, and the left engine’s oil tank quantity began to decrease from 16.25 quarts. About 15 seconds after the bird ingestion, the left engine’s core speed (N2) was below 62 percent rpm which would have de-energized the engine’s running relay and subsequently closed the pressure regulating shutoff valve (PRSOV). About 28 seconds later, the left engine’s N1 stabilized at 6 percent rpm with an oil tank quantity of 3.5 quarts. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSystem Description &#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with two CFM International LEAP-1B engines, which incorporate a load reduction device (LRD) designed to minimize aircraft and engine damage during a significant fan imbalance. The design was intended to enable the fan to be mechanically disconnected from the turbomachinery, thus reducing the severity of the vibration that is transmitted into the airframe. LRD devices are a mechanical design feature and do not require any pilot intervention. When the LRD activates due to excessive vibration, engine oil enters the compressor upstream of the pneumatic bleed ports, which supply bleed air to the cabin and flight deck. &#x0D;\nPressure Regulating Shutoff Valve &#x0D;\nEngine bleed air from the high-pressure compressor travels from the engine to the pressure regulating shutoff valve (PRSOV, see figure 2) and then to the left and right air conditioning packs. When closed, the PRSOV prevents bleed air from the affected engine from entering the airplane. The valve closes automatically if the engine running relay is de-energized (the affected engine spools down below 62% minimum N2), the engine start switch is moved to cutoff, or the engine fire switch is pulled. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Simplified engine bleed air diagram with PRSOV depicted. (Copyright © Boeing. Reprinted with permission of Boeing.)&#x0D;\nConditioned air from the left air conditioning pack (supplied by left engine) is normally distributed to the flight deck. Conditioned air from the right air conditioning pack (supplied by right engine) and excess air from the left air conditioning pack, and recirculated air are combined in the mixing manifold and is normally distributed to the cabin (see figure 3).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3.  The air conditioning graphic referenced is a simplified system description. (Copyright © Boeing. Reprinted with permission of Boeing.)&#x0D;\nNote: The figure does not show the location of the pack flow control valves, which are upstream of the trim air supply.&#x0D;\nPrevious Related Event&#x0D;\nOn March 5, 2023, Southwest Airlines flight 3923 struck birds shortly after departure from Havana, Cuba. The birds struck the airplane nose and the right engine, and vapor fog entered the passenger cabin. After making an emergency landing at the airport, the airplane was evacuated; one passenger sustained a minor injury. The Instituto de Aeronautica Civil de Cuba is investigating this serious incident, and the NTSB is participating in the investigation and has assigned an Accredited Representative as the State of manufacturer, design, operator and registry.  &#x0D;\nSafety Actions &#x0D;\nAfter the MSY event, Boeing released a Flight Crew Operations Manual Bulletin and made updates to the systems description in the Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM), and the Quick Reference Handbook. CFM International, in collaboration with Boeing, has begun work on a software design update. In addition, Southwest Airlines notified their pilots of the MSY and Havana events and incorporated Boeing’s updates. &#x0D;\nThe investigation continues.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Southwest Airlines flight 2217 struck a bird while climbing though 6,000 ft. after departure from the St. Louis Lambert International Airport (STL), St. Louis, Missouri. &#x0D;\nAccording to the flight crew, during the climb they saw a “quick flash” pass diagonally from right to left across the nose of the airplane, followed by a “thud” sound. Which they surmised was a bird that had impacted the nose or belly area of the airplane. After confirming that the flight controls, engines, and pressurization system were operating normally, they decided to continue to their destination. &#x0D;\nThey advised the company of a possible bird strike via an aircraft communicating and reporting system (ACARS) message to coordinate with maintenance for an inspection and damage assessment upon landing. The flight continued normally with no change in the performance or operation of the airplane and landed without further incident. &#x0D;\nAfter landing the crew performed a post-flight walk around to search for any evidence of a bird strike, when they discovered impact damage to the leading edge of the left horizontal stabilizer (see figure 1). Maintenance personnel subsequently discovered a crack, about 12 inches long, in the left horizonal stabilizer lower spar chord. Although the bird impact caused substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer, the flight crew was able to control the airplane and the captain reported that “the flight controls and everything felt normal”. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – Photo of the left horizontal stabilizer leading edge showing the location of the bird impact.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "About 7 months before the accident, a different pilot rejected a takeoff roll uneventfully in the accident airplane due to a partial loss of engine power. Subsequent maintenance revealed water in the fuel system. The water was purged from the fuel system and a corroded electric fuel pump was replaced. The airplane was operated about 10 hours from the time of that maintenance until the accident. However, it had not flown for about 1 month before the accident. &#x0D;\nThe pilot completed a preflight inspection, which included draining all three fuel sumps and adding 1 quart of oil to the engine. During the accident flight, the takeoff and first touch-and-go landing were completed uneventfully. During initial climb from a second touch-and-go landing, as the pilot retracted the landing gear about 100 ft above ground level (agl), the engine noise was quieter, and the airplane started to sink.

    "FactualNarrative": "On December 18, 2023, about 1340 eastern standard time, a Beech A24R, N52LV, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Miami, Florida. The commercial pilot and pilot-rated passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nAccording to air traffic control information, the airplane had not flown for about 1 month before the accident flight. The commercial pilot stated that she owned the airplane and was seated in the left seat. he purpose of the flight was to familiarize the flight instructor in the right seat with the airplane. The flight instructor had never flown the make and model airplane, but the flight school he worked at was considering using the airplane for training. The commercial pilot showed the flight instructor how she would complete a preflight inspection, which included draining all three fuel sumps. She also added 1 quart of oil to the engine.&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that they departed runway 27R at Miami Executive Airport (TMB), remained in the traffic pattern, and completed one touch-and-go landing uneventfully. She further stated that during initial climb from a second touch-and-go landing, as she retracted the landing gear about 100 ft agl, the engine noise was quieter, and the airplane started to sink. She verified that the throttle, mixture, and propeller controls were full forward; however, the airplane continued to sink. She lowered the nose to avoid a stall and landed with the landing gear retracted on the runway.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor reported that since he was a passenger, he did not familiarize himself with the airplane’s flight manual before the accident flight. He stated that the pilot performed a preflight inspection. During initial climb from the accident touch-and-go, he recalled the pilot retracting the landing gear about 100 ft agl. He could not recall if the pilot retracted the flaps on the ground or when she retracted the landing gear. After the landing gear retracted, he felt a decrease in performance. He was wearing a noise-cancelling headset and could not recall if there was a decrease in engine noise, but the pilot reported a loss of engine power. At that time, he looked at the throttle, mixture, and propeller controls. He remembered that they were all in the full-forward position. He did not remember seeing the tachometer. The flight instructor made an emergency radio transmission as the pilot performed a forced landing onto the runway.&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that it came to rest upright in a grassy area about 75 ft from the departure end of the runway. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage. The fuel tanks were full and, when the inspector drained the sumps, he observed less than 1 ounce of water combined from all sumps. He noted that all three propeller blades were curled at the tip and propeller gouge marks were observed in the asphalt at the end of the runway. The inspector was able to rotate the propeller and confirm continuity of the drivetrain to the rear accessory section, with both magnetos rotating. He also obtained compression on all four cylinders and noted that the fuel injector nozzles were absent of contamination.&#x0D;\nThe FAA inspector further stated that approximately 7 months before the accident, a different pilot rejected a takeoff roll in the airplane due to a partial loss of engine power. Subsequent maintenance revealed water in the fuel system. The water was purged from the fuel system and a corroded electric fuel pump was replaced. Review of maintenance records revealed that the airplane was operated about 10 hours from the time of that maintenance until the accident. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On December 17, 2023, about 1414 central standard time, a Beech B36TC, N70SL, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Burnet, Texas. The pilot and passenger received serious injuries. The airplane was operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations as a Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated the preflight, engine start, engine runup, and takeoff roll were normal. While climbing through 200 to 300 ft agl, the engine began to surge and lose power. The airplane was unable to climb, and the pilot was unsuccessful using emergency procedures at regaining engine power. The pilot said he could not see an area suitable to land on except for a road. During the landing, the airplane’s right wing struck a car and exploded into flames. The airplane landed in a field and was destroyed by impact forces and postcrash fire.&#x0D;\nA witness stated that he saw the airplane intermittently emitting black smoke from the exhaust as it climbed out slowly after takeoff. A video of the takeoff showed dark smoke emitting from the airplane’s exhaust area. A second witness saw the airplane fly southbound at an estimated altitude of 100 to 150 ft agl and was having difficulty gaining altitude. The airplane’s landing gear was retracted, the wing flaps were retracted, and the propeller was turning. The airplane lost altitude and descended behind a hill. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine-driven fuel pump assembly was removed for testing at Continental Aerospace Technologies, Mobile, Alabama, under the supervision of the NTSB Investigator-in-Charge. The fuel pump assembly was placed on a test bench and during testing at an input speed of 2,700 rpm, the fuel flow was 38.42 gallons per hour and the maximum limit for the test was 34.9 gallons per hour. There was no test fluid leakage from the fuel pump assembly during the test. The fuel pump assembly was removed from the test bench and disassembled to determine the length of its internal aneroid. The fuel pump assembly’s aneroid adjustment screw was extended outward 0.4480 inch. The internal aneroid was not elongated and was of comparable length to the aneroid of a new production fuel pump assembly, which indicated a normal condition. According to Continental Aerospace Technologies, the greater the outward extension of the aneroid adjustment screw, the greater the output of fuel flow from the fuel pump assembly. A review of the engine maintenance logbooks showed that the fuel pump was overhauled in June 2004, and that the engine was overhauled April 14, 2022. There were no other references to work or adjustments done on the fuel pump. &#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook–Powerplant (2023), Chapter 10, Engine Maintenance &amp; Operation, Engine Troubleshooting, Figure 10-52, lists symptoms of a rich mixture to include black exhaust smoke and sluggish engine operation. -",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On December 16, 2023, about 1654 Pacific standard time, a Cessna 172G airplane, N3992L, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Independence, Oregon. The pilot and the two pilot-rated-passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the owner of the airplane, he allowed the pilot to use the airplane to gain his private pilot certificate and to continue using the airplane to gain his instrument rating and commercial certificate. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot’s flight instructor, the pilot explained to him that he and a pilot-rated-passenger were going to fly to the McMinnville Municipal Airport (MMV), McMinnville, Oregon, to practice instrument approaches [in VFR conditions]. The pilot-rated-passenger had an instrument airplane rating and would act as a safety pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutomatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data recorded the airplane as it departed the Independence State Airport (7S5), Independence, Oregon about 1500, and flew directly to MMV. The airplane made an approach to runway 22, followed by maneuvering in an area about 12 miles southwest of the airport. The airplane then maneuvered to the northeast of the airport and conducted a second approach, to runway 22, to a full stop at 1608. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor had been monitoring the progress of the flight on an internet ADS-B provider and grew concerned due to fog that had built up around 7S5. He called the pilot who was on the ground at MMV. During the conversation, the flight instructor advised the pilot not to return to 7S5 because of the low visibility and ceiling of about 500 ft. The pilot explained that he would fly to 7S5, assess the conditions and decide to either land or divert to McNary Field Airport (SLE) Salem, Oregon, or possibly return to MMV. The pilot informed the flight instructor that he had picked up a second pilot-rated-passenger at MMV. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADS-B data showed that the airplane departed MMV at 1638 and proceeded directly to 7S5. A recording of the common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) for 7S5 revealed the pilot made ten-mile and a five-mile position reports that included an intention to land. About three minutes later the pilot reported entering the downwind leg for landing to runway 34. Shortly afterwards five clicks were recorded from the CTAF frequency, consistent with activating the pilot-controlled lighting to medium intensity. About one minute later, the last call made by the pilot advised 7S5 traffic that “92L was final for [runway] 34.” The last moments of the ADS-B data recorded the airplane as it entered the 7S5 downwind leg, about traffic pattern altitude of 1,200 ft mean sea level. The airplane then entered a descending 180° left-hand turn. During the turn, the airplane overshot the runway centerline to the east, corrected but overshot the centerline to the west. The last ADS-B data point recorded the airplane about 1500 ft southwest of the accident site, which was about 670 ft west of the approach end of runaway 34.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest inverted on the edge of an open field, adjacent to the airport property. A postaccident fire reduced the fuselage to ash. The wings and empennage were not consumed by the fire. The engine had separated from the airplane and was about 60 ft northwest of the main wreckage. The propeller remained attached to the engine with both propeller blades exhibiting chordwise bends aft, toward the engine. The first point of probable impact was a wooden power distribution line support pole, originally about 80 ft tall, and about 60 ft southeast of the wreckage. The pole had separated into three major sections. The main section, from the ground up to about 69 ft, remained installed in the ground and was affixed with multiple power distribution lines. The middle section, about 12 ft in length, fell onto the right wing. A white color transfer was observed on this section. The top 4 ft of the pole had fragmented and was strewn about the wreckage. The pole had a dual-lamp, red warning light affixed to its top. The warning light separated from the pole and was among the wreckage. At least one power distribution line had fractured and fell to the ground near the wreckage. A section of the power distribution line was in the fuselage section of the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was recovered to a secure facility.",

The flight instructor sustained minor injuries and the private pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor and private pilot were conducting a cross-country flight at night when they felt a “shudder” followed by a loss of engine power. The loss of power was accompanied by a loss of oil pressure and dual engine control unit (ECU) failure. The flight instructor took control of the airplane and used the checklist to restart the (diesel) engine. The engine restarted momentarily but again lost power shortly after. The flight instructor was able to restart the engine again, but the cockpit began to fill with smoke before the engine lost power a final time. The flight instructor then made a forced landing to an interstate. Just prior to landing, the airplane struck an energized power line, and the airplane impacted the ground and caugh fire. &#x0D;\nThe airplane wreckage was recovered to a secure facility for further examination. At the time the airplane was recovered, a connecting rod was observed separated from the engine.&#x0D;\nThe airplane received its airworthiness certificate on September 25, 2023, and it’s last 100-hr maintenance inspection was completed on December 9, 2023. At that time, the airplane and engine had accrued a total of 95 flight hours.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On December 14, 2023, about 1218 central standard time (CST), a Pilatus PC-12/45, N188PC, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Christoval, Texas. The pilot, one passenger, and three pets were fatally injured. The flight was conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. &#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control (ATC) recordings and automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B) data revealed that the airplane had departed Jacksonville Executive at Craig Airport (CRG), Jacksonville, Florida, about 0751 CST, and was en route to San Angelo Regional Airport (SJT), San Angelo, Texas. The pilot was receiving radar vectors for the RNAV (GPS) runway 36 approach to SJT and was level about 4,300 ft mean sea level (msl). About 1211, the pilot reported to ATC that the tops of the clouds were variable between 4,100 ft and 4,400 ft msl.  &#x0D;\nAt 12:17:24, ATC stated, “turn right heading 030 maintain 4,300 [ft msl] until established on the final approach course, cleared RNAV 36 approach”&#x0D;\nAt 12:17:32, the flight track passed through the final approach course and continued a shallow right turn&#x0D;\nAt 12:17:36, the pilot stated “we overshot it”&#x0D;\nAt 12:17:39, ATC stated “I know that’s why a gave you a 030”&#x0D;\nAt 12:17:40, the flight track began a right descending turn about 1,000 fpm&#x0D;\nAt 12:17:44, the descent rate was about 5,000 fpm and the right turn steepened&#x0D;\nAt 12:17:47, the pilot stated “we got a problem” and was the final recorded transmission from the accident airplane&#x0D;\nAt 12:17:49, the flight track continued in a steep right turn with a descent rate about 15,000 fpm&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Google Earth view of the accident area with the ADS-B flight track, the RNAV (GPS) runway 36 initial approach fix “DBASE”, and the 002° final approach course.  &#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted trees and terrain about 15 miles south of SJT and the wreckage debris was aligned on a 100° magnetic heading. The initial impact point was defined by a small tree that was cut at a 24° angle slanted down toward south and surrounded by small wreckage debris, which included pieces of the right wing tip and a green navigation light. The initial ground impact crater was immediately adjacent to the tree, measured about 1 ft deep by 20 ft long, and contained a lot of small wreckage debris and one propeller blade. The main wreckage was located about 500 ft to the east of the initial impact area. A large section of the left wing remained mostly intact and was found on the right side of the debris field near the main wreckage. The area between the initial impact and the main wreckage contained a significant amount of airplane parts and wreckage debris. The main portion of the engine was located about 870 ft from the initial impact area. The farthest piece of wreckage was a main landing gear tire that was located about 1,320 ft from the initial impact. Several portions of the wreckage sustained thermal damage and contained black soot.&#x0D;\nThe engine components exhibited torsional deformation and rotational signatures. The propeller impact-separated from the engine with the propeller shaft and associated reduction gearbox bearings still attached. The cylinder, piston, and feathering spring assembly impact-separated from the propeller hub and were found near the propeller assembly about 50 ft from the engine. The propeller assembly and two blades remained attached and two of the four blades impact-separated from the propeller assembly. One blade fractured from the blade retention pocket and was found in the initial impact crater. The other blade fractured at the shank and was found just east of the initial impact crater in the debris field. All four blades exhibited chordwise rotational scoring, leading edge gouges, and compound bend and twist signatures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Aerial image of the accident site facing east. The initial impact area, main wreckage, and end of the wreckage debris field are labeled in red. &#x0D;\nThe archived meteorological information and the accident pilot’s report to ATC revealed that the airplane was likely in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) during the approach. There was potential for turbulence in clouds, no icing below 11,000 ft, and no significant precipitation noted.&#x0D;\nMaintenance records revealed that the airplane had undergone an annual inspection which was completed on November 22, 2023, at aircraft total time 3,990.1 hours. &#x0D;\nThe pilot’s electronic flight logbook revealed that in the last year he had accumulated about 111 hours in the accident airplane, of which 16.3 hours were logged in actual IMC. &#x0D;\nIn 2020, the airplane was upgraded with Garmin avionics and components that included two Garmin G600TXi touchscreen flight displays, two Garmin GTN750Xi flight navigators, a Garmin GI275 electronic attitude indicator, and a Garmin GMC 605 autopilot controller. These devices were located in the wreckage and were sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Laboratory for examination and data extraction.  &#x0D;\nThe wreckage was retained for further examination and testing.",

The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that the purpose of the flight was to retrieve that airplane following its annual inspection. As the airplane approached the destination airport, the airplane’s interior lighting dimmed, and the pilot used a flashlight to view the instrument panel. He selected the landing gear down and mistook the reflection from the flashlight as a gear down indication. When he was about to touch down, the propeller tips contacted the runway and the pilot applied power to go around. &#x0D;\nDuring the go-around, the pilot used the emergency gear extension procedure to lower the landing gear, but the airplane was not able to maintain altitude and he executed a forced landing to a field. During the forced landing the airplane struck power lines, impacted the field, and slid into large round hay bales that were in the field. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings.",

To arrest the rapid descent, the first pilot said she initiated a go-around by applying full engine power, but the rapid descend continued, and the airplane touched down hard before becoming airborne again.&#x0D;\nAirport wind conditions at the time of the accident were reported to be, 120°, at 10 knots, with peak gusts to 17 knots, which translates to a quartering, right tailwind.&#x0D;\nThe second pilot reported that, prior to the accident sequence, as the approach to Runway 4L continued, the first pilot decided to lower the nose to gain airspeed and enter ground effect. The second pilot stated that, as the airplane passed through 75 to 50 ft above the runway, the airplane encountered an unusual sink rate, and he reacted by pulling back on the yoke as he yelled “flare” just before the airplane touched down hard. The second pilot reported that the airplane subsequently touched down hard, bounced back into the air, and the first pilot then initiated a go-around.&#x0D;\nAfter establishing a climb on the go-around, the first pilot transferred control to the second pilot, who subsequently performed a precautionary full-stop landing to check for damage. During the landing roll, the nose wheel deflated, and the airplane came to a stop on the runway, disabled.&#x0D;\nA post-flight inspection revealed that the airplane sustained substantial damage to the firewall and fuselage. The pilots reported that there were no pre-accident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.",

The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to a family member the pilot was flying from Sun Valley Airport (A20), Bullhead City, Arizona to pick up a passenger from Prescott Regional Airport – Ernest A. Love Field (PRC), Prescott, Arizona. Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast data showed the airplane departed from runway 36 at A20 about 1533. About 14 minutes after takeoff the pilot reported to Air Traffic Control (ATC) that he had lost oil pressure. Radio and radar contact were lost shortly after the reported loss of oil pressure.&#x0D;\nThe airplane subsequently impacted rocky desert terrain near an unimproved road. A post impact fire consumed the cockpit, right wing, and a portion of the fuselage. The empennage sustained minor damage and flight control continuity was confirmed from the cabin to each of the flight control surfaces. The engine remained attached to the airframe by avionics and control cables. A portion of the No. 4 cylinder piston connecting rod was found outside of the crankcase when the engine cowling was removed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Post-accident image of connecting rod on the ground next to engine (Courtesy of LEA)",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On December 10, 2023, about 1019 central standard time, a Beech A23-24 airplane, N6945Q, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The pilot and his passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to recordings of air traffic control (ATC) tower communications at Wiley Post Airport (PWA), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, about 1015:37, the pilot told the tower controller that he was holding short of runway 35R on taxiway A1 and was ready to depart to the north under visual flight rules (VFR). The tower controller then cleared the pilot for takeoff on runway 35R.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) track data revealed that the airplane’s liftoff occurred before midfield and that the airplane was climbing though 300 ft above ground level (agl) as it flew over the end of runway 35R.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1016:57, a security camera located on a hangar near the east end of taxiway A5 captured the airplane in a climb from runway 35R. As the airplane continued the climb to the north there was possible evidence of intermittent smoke trailing behind the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to ADS-B track data, after takeoff the airplane continued in the climb while on a north ground track, as shown in figure 1. About 1018:26, the airplane entered a left turn toward the south and the pilot told the tower controller, “we are going to return for landing.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. ADS-B track data for flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1018:39, the pilot told the tower controller, “we are losing power.” About 1018:45, the airplane was halfway through a 180° turn toward the airport when it entered a descent from about 2,100 ft mean sea level (msl). About 1018:52, the pilot stated that he was “declaring an emergency.” The tower controller subsequently cleared the pilot to land on the runway of his choice. About 1019:29, the tower controller stated that the surface wind was from 320° at 5 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ADS-B track data showed the airplane continued the descent toward the airport and became aligned with runway 17R. At 1019:50, the final ADS-B return was recorded about 0.5 mile north of the runway 17R threshold at an altitude of about 1,375 ft msl (100 ft agl). At that time, the airplane’s ground speed and vertical speed were 64 knots and -704 feet per minute, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe same security camera that captured the airplane’s takeoff from runway 35R also captured the airplane as it descended toward the airport. At 1019:13, the video footage showed the airplane descending with light colored smoke trailing the airplane. Beginning at 1020:04, dark smoke began rising from the accident site location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo witnesses reported there was smoke trailing from the airplane and that the engine was running rough shortly before the accident. One witness noted that the trailing smoke was a gray/white color. A third witness stated that the engine was sputtering as it flew over his position and then it made a 180° turn toward the airport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aircraft impacted a 15-foot-tall pile of concrete rubble at a concrete recycling facility on an approximate 180° heading. The upper portion of nose landing gear, the nose gear fork, nose wheel and tire, and the right main landing gear were found separated among the top of the rubble, as shown in figure 2. Tire markings and red paint transfer (matching the aircraft color) were observed on multiple pieces of concrete. One of the tire tracks was outlined by an oily substance consistent with engine oil. The fractured nose gear segment and nose wheel tire were coated with a thin layer of what appeared to be engine oil, as shown in figure 3. The right lower portion of the cowling, also coated with oil, came to rest next to the nose gear segment. The outboard six feet of the right wing fracture separated and came to rest inverted at the bottom of the rubble pile and sustained significant thermal damage that consumed portions of the skin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage came to rest in an open grass area on a south-southwest heading about 40 ft beyond the concrete rubble pile, as shown in figure 4. The main wreckage included the fuselage, engine, propeller, left wing, inboard portion of the right wing, and tail section. The left main landing gear separated from the wing and was found about 60 ft past the main wreckage. All structural components and flight control surfaces were located at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the wreckage sustained heavy thermal damage that consumed the fuselage skin and structure. The inboard portion of the right-wing separated at the wing root and came to rest beside the fuselage. Thermally damaged portions of the horizontal stabilator and the tail beacon were identified beneath the fire damaged section of the cockpit and right wing. The upper surface of the right-wing integral fuel tank was consumed by fire. The left-wing upper skins forward of the main spar from the root to the aileron were mostly consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the flight control system was limited due to the extent of thermal damage; however, there was no evidence of a flight control cable separation. The flap selector assembly was found in the flaps retracted position. The airframe examination revealed no evidence of a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Accident site overview (Aerial photo provided by Oklahoma City PD)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Nose landing gear fork, wheel, and tire covered in engine oil&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. Main wreckage at the accident site&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was normally parked in a hangar located at the southeast corner of PWA. Examination of the hangar revealed 11 empty 1-quart bottles of Aeroshell W100 engine oil. Additionally, there was evidence of minor oil puddling on the asphalt floor and a discernable nose wheel tire tread track in oil, as shown in figure 5.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no evidence of an oil leak on the asphalt between the hangar door and the unmarked asphalt taxiway alongside the row of hangars.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was evidence of a significant oil leak with puddling on the unmarked asphalt taxiway, as shown in figure 6, consistent with the airplane being stationary for an extended period with the engine running. Additionally, there was evidence of oil spray from the propeller wash blowing oil aft. The nose landing gear deposited an easily discernable, dark black, oily, tire track as the airplane moved toward taxiway C1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was evidence of a smaller oil puddle near where the unmarked asphalt taxiway transitioned onto concrete taxiway C1, as shown in figure 7.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was evidence of oil drips and nose wheel tire tracks on taxiway C1, as shown in figure 8. The oil drips and nose wheel track continued to the runup pad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was evidence of a significant oil leak with puddling on the runup pad, as shown in figure 9 and figure 10, consistent with the airplane being stationary for an extended period with the engine running. Additionally, there was evidence of oil spray caused by the propeller wash blowing oil aft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditional oil drips and nose wheel tire tracks were evident as the airplane taxied from the runup pad toward the hold short lines for runway 35R.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was evidence of an oil leak where the airplane came to stop before the hold short lines for runway 35R, as shown in figure 11.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Evidence of oil leak and nose landing gear tire tread mark on hangar floor&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6. Evidence of oil leak and nose wheel tire tread track outside of the hangar&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 7. Evidence of oil leak near the transition to taxiway C1&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 8.

Evidence of oil leak on the runup pad (facing west)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 11. Evidence of oil leak near the hold short line for runway 35R&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the mounts, and the mount remained attached to the firewall. There was significant evidence that engine sustained substantial thermal damage during the postimpact fire, as shown in figure 12. The exhaust was crushed upward and aft. The rear of the oil sump and lower portion of the accessory case was consumed by fire. There was an opening punched out of the top of engine case inboard of the No. 2 cylinder base, as shown in figure 13. There were also multiple holes punched out of the lower side of the engine case inside the oil sump, between cylinder Nos. 1 and 2. Connecting rods Nos. 1, 2, and 3 were found broken and deformed. Numerous pieces of connecting rod, rod caps, and rod bolts were found in remaining portion of engine oil sump, as shown in figure 14. There was a crack of the forward lower left crankcase between base of cylinder No. 2 and the case split. Visual examination inside of the crankcase (through the crankcase holes and by borescope inspection) and the cylinder rocker boxes generally revealed a lack of oil wetting of the internal drivetrain components, consistent with prolonged heat exposure during the postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 12. Engine on hoist with propeller removed&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 13. Hole in upper engine crankcase&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 14. Fragments of connecting rod, connecting rod caps, connection rod bolts and nuts, bearing material, and engine crankcase.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe remote mounted oil filter assembly was found deformed by fire. The oil filter was safety tied with 0.02-inch safety wire. The oil hoses were found thermally damaged and separated from the remote oil filter assembly and the filter adapter, as shown in figure 15. The aluminum fittings were found melted. The oil cooler was also mostly consumed by fire with only the center core remaining. The oil cooler hoses were found separated from the oil cooler assembly with the attach fittings mostly consumed by fire, as shown in figure 16. Both the supply and return hose ends at the oil cooler assembly contained resolidified aluminum, consistent with the fittings being in place during the postimpact fire. The oil cooler hoses remained attached at the rear of the engine. All oil and fuel hoses were thermally compromised.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 15. Oil filter and supply/return hoses&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 16. Oil cooler with segments of the oil supply/return hoses&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cylinders were borescope inspected with no anomalies observed. The No. 2 exhaust push rod shroud tube was found dislodged. Numerous shroud tubes were thermally deformed. All oil drain-back tubes exhibited significant thermal damage consistent with prolonged exposure to fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller governor drive adapter was found dislodged from accessory case. The propeller governor was mostly consumed by fire. The propeller governor oil line separated from the steel fitting at the governor and where it returns into the crankcase with both aluminum B-nuts consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth magnetos were found thermally deformed during the postimpact fire. All ignition leads were thermally damaged. The top spark plugs electrodes appeared worn, with a dark sooty appearance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel servo was found fractured separated from its flange. The servo was found partially deformed. The throttle and mixture cables remained attached to their respective arms. The flow divider was found partially deformed, with the diaphragm consumed by fire. The engine driven fuel pump was also found mostly thermally damaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe initial source of the engine oil leak could not be conclusively determined due to mechanical damage sustained during multiple connecting rod separations and thermal damage sustained during the postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller remained attached to the engine crankshaft. The pitch change mechanism and spring were separated from the front of the hub. The blades remained attached and did not move freely. The outboard third of Blade A was melted along the training edge. The blade was bent aft about 10º midspan. Blade B was bent forward 10º midspan. Neither blade exhibited leading edge scoring or gouging.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane’s recording tachometer was destroyed by the postimpact fire which prevented calculation of the airplane’s airframe and engine times at the time of the accident. Additionally, the airplane’s logbooks were not located during the on-scene investigation, which prevented a comprehensive review of the airplane’s maintenance history. An aviation mechanic, who had recently worked on the airplane, provided copies of three logbook pages, two recent logbook entries, and a prebuy inspection report.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to available maintenance documentation, the last major overhaul of the Lycoming IO-360-A2B engine, s/n L-3904-51A, was completed on June 6, 2005, at 924.9 hours since new. On December 24, 2008, at 240.3 hours since major overhaul (SMOH), all four cylinders were removed and overhauled due to low compression and excessive oil consumption.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn April 15, 2023, during the last annual inspection, at 683.8 hours SMOH, the engine oil and oil filter were replaced, No. 1 cylinder was serviced due to low compression. The No. 1 cylinder bore was honed, and new gaskets and hold-down nuts installed. The airplane was returned to service following an engine ground run and subsequent test flight that did not reveal any oil leaks or anomalies. The associated engine log entry indicated that the engine had been inspected in accordance with an annual inspection and determined to be in an airworthy condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA registration records, the pilot purchased the airplane on June 30, 2023. A prebuy inspection report, dated June 22, 2023, indicated that the airplane’s airframe total time (AFTT) and engine SMOH were 1,585.1 hours and 684.5 hours, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn November 11, 2023, at 699.5 hours SMOH, the engine oil and oil filter were replaced, and an oil sample was submitted to a laboratory for analysis. The airplane was returned to service following an engine test run that did not reveal any oil leaks or anomalies. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe oil analysis report, dated December 5, 2023, indicated elevated levels of aluminum, chromium, and iron. The laboratory commented that there was “a lot of metal in this sample” and that internal corrosion could be an issue if the airplane had been sitting. The laboratory suggested a borescope inspection, compression test, monitor oil temperature, and check the oil filter for evidence of metal. Additionally, the laboratory report stated that an excessive oil consumption could also be an indication of engine issues.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 1, 2023, at 708.4 hours SMOH, a E-Z Heat oil sump heater was installed on the engine.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On December 8, 2023, about 1315 Alaska standard time (AKST), a Piper PA-18-150 airplane, N1880P was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Anchor Point, Alaska. The pilot was fatally injured, the passenger sustained critical injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nA friend of the pilot, with knowledge of the planned itinerary, stated that the flight originated from a private airstrip on Pike Lake near King Salmon, Alaska. The airplane was expected to fly Northeast towards Chinitna Bay and cross the Cook Inlet to Anchor Point, Alaska before turning Southeast for Homer, Alaska. The friend received a text message from the accident pilot confirming the airplane’s departure from Pike Lake at 11:29 AKST.&#x0D;\nA witness near the accident site stated that he heard the airplane’s engine rpm increase which drew his attention, then looked up and saw the airplane inverted and spinning in a nose-low attitude towards the ground.   &#x0D;\nReview of a video from a vehicle dash-mounted camera showed the airplane in an inverted flat spin before disappearing behind trees (Figure 1). The video captures the spinning, inverted airplane as it descends vertically, but it does not record the initiating event. Additionally, the dash-mounted video revealed that as the airplane enters the top of the video screen, the airplane’s left wing was folded against the fuselage as the descending wreckage entered an area of tree and brush-covered terrain.    &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Screenshot of dash camera video&#x0D;\nTwo investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) Alaska Regional Office responded to the accident site and examined the airplane wreckage on December 9.

Airplane wreckage as found by NTSB investigators on December 9&#x0D;\nDuring the detailed on-scene examination, the investigative team retained various components for additional examination and testing, and results are pending.&#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest inverted in an area of low brush. The left wing was partially attached to the fuselage; both lift struts were fractured. The right wing and right wing struts remained attached and were cut by first responders. The fuselage was twisted and sustained impact damage. Control continuity was established between the cockpit flight controls and their respective control surfaces.  The engine remained attached to the airframe; one propeller blade was located next to the wreckage; the other blade tip was separated. &#x0D;\nA detailed wreckage examination is pending.",

The pilot was not injured. The flight was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations part 91 positioning flight.&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was to reposition the airplane from Waco, Texas (ACT), to Boerne, Texas (5C1). The airplane had just undergone an inspection, and the new owners were taking possession of the airplane. The pilot reviewed the logbooks and conducted a pre-flight inspection, and then filed an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan to 5C1.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that the takeoff and initial climb was normal.  Passing through about 11,500 ft, the right engine rpms increased immediately to about 4,500 RPMs. The pilot reported that he thought that the right propeller governor had failed. He heard the right engine “screaming.,” due to the excessive RPMs. The pilot then pulled back the right propellor condition lever with no change, so he pulled the mixture back to near cutoff which reduced the RPMs to about 2,000 RPMs. The right engine continued to run, and the pilot turned back toward ACT, with the thought that the airplane could hold altitude or climb about 200-300 feet-per-minute (FPM). &#x0D;\nThe airspeed started to decay, and the airplane descend about 1,000 - 2,000 FPM just to hold sufficient airspeed. The pilot pushed the left engine controls to full throttle, full propeller, and full mixture while he tried to “milk” the right engine to produce at least neutral thrust vice negative thrust. The pilot declared an emergency with Air Traffic Control when the airplane was about 25 miles from ACT. The McGregor Executive Airport (PWG) airport was about 20 miles away, so the pilot changed his emergency landing location to PWG.&#x0D;\nThe right engine continued to run but did not produce any power. The pilot tried various propeller, mixture, and throttle settings, but the engine would have “massive” vibrations. when the airplane was about 1,500 ft, and about 4 miles from PWG, the pilot thought that he was not going to make the airport and elected to make a forced landing into a flat, harvested corn field. Upon making a gear-up landing in the field, the airplane travelled about 100 ft, and came to rest upright. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the underside of the fuselage. The pilot exited the airplane uninjured, and the airplane was recovered to a secure facility in Lancaster, Texas, for further examination.",

    "FactualNarrative": "On December 7, 2023, about 1248 eastern standard time, a Cessna 172N, N906KS, was substantially damaged when it was involved in accident near Zephyrhills, Florida. The flight instructor and student pilot were seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the student pilot, he had about 11 hours of total flight experience. He stated that he and the flight instructor flew from Lakeland Linder International Airport (LAL), Lakeland, Florida, to Zephyrhills Municipal Airport (ZPH), Zephyrhills, Florida, to practice some touch-and-go landings on runway 5. The flight instructor demonstrated the first touch-and-go landing. The student pilot recalled performing the second touch-and-go landing but did not remember what occurred during the third touch-and-go landing. He recalled waking up in the hospital. &#x0D;\nDue to his injuries, the flight instructor was unable to provide a statement. &#x0D;\nAn airport surveillance video showed the airplane flying about 50 ft above ground level in a nose high, left wing low attitude. The left bank continued to steepen, the airplane’s nose pitched downward, and the airplane began descending steeply toward the ground. &#x0D;\nInitial examination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that it came to rest on the left side of runway 5. The left wing and engine mounts sustained substantial damage.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was subsequently examined after it was recovered from the accident site. Continuity of the flight control cables was traced through separations that were consistent with overload or cuts that were made by recovery personnel to facilitate transportation of the wreckage. All of the primary flight controls were free to move by hand, and felt smooth through those movements. The top spark plugs of the engine were removed and the propeller was rotated by hand; thumb compression was established on all cylinders. Engine powertrain and valvetrain continuity were verified to the rear accessory section of the engine. Both magnetos produced spark on all leads when their input drives were rotated by an electric drill. The carburetor was opened for examination; it was clean and clear of debris. No anomalies were noted with either the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On December 7, 2023, at 1103 central standard time (CST), a Beech 35-C33, N5891J, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Pulaski, Tennessee. The private pilot and passenger sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe flight originated from Knoxville Downtown Island Airport (DKX), Knoxville, Tennessee, about 0948 CST and was enroute to Saline County Regional Airport (SUZ), Benton, Arkansas. Preliminary Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data revealed that after takeoff from DKX, the airplane climbed and turned to a ground track of 255°, then leveled off for about 12 minutes at 2,500 ft mean sea level (msl), before climbing to 6,400 ft msl. &#x0D;\nThe pilot was in contact with air traffic control and had requested flight following services. As the flight was about 140 nautical miles into the trip, the controller advised the pilot that she was left of course. The pilot acknowledged and responded that she was correcting. &#x0D;\nAbout 1019, the airplane entered the first of a series of climbs and descents with corresponding fluctuations in its observed groundspeed. During these oscillations, which varied in magnitude, the airplane’s altitude varied between about 6,400 ft and about 5,300 ft. About 1057, the airplane entered a descent that arrested about 4,300 ft at a groundspeed of 143 kts, after which it climbed to 6,050 ft and slowed to 85 kts. The airplane then began to descend rapidly before ADS-B contact was lost in the vicinity of the accident site. During the last several seconds of the flight, the airplane was on a ground track of 262° descending at a groundspeed that reached a maximum of 228 kts, and the estimated maximum descent rate was about 11,900 ft per minute.&#x0D;\nDuring these altitude fluctuations, the controller twice provided instructions to the pilot to contact the Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Center; however, neither of the instructions were acknowledged by the pilot. During the final moments of the flight, a faint communication from the pilot stating the airplane’s registration and “Debonaire” followed by an emergency declaration and an unintelligible word. About 60 seconds later, a faint and largely unintelligible transmission from the passenger was transmitted. The controller’s subsequent attempts to contact the pilot were unanswered, and there were no further communications from either the pilot or passenger. &#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted hilly, wooded terrain at an elevation of 971 ft, with the wreckage path oriented on a heading of about 268° magnetic. The wreckage was highly fragmented, and the debris field extended in a fan-like pattern about 300 ft long. The tops of several trees leading to the main wreckage were cut off at progressively lower heights leading up to the main impact with the ground. During the accident sequence, the fuel tanks were breached, and a post-impact fire spread in the vicinity of the wreckage to the surrounding trees and undergrowth.  &#x0D;\nA witness in the vicinity of the accident site stated that the airplane flew overhead at a high rate of speed and described that the engine was running when it impacted the ground. &#x0D;\nAll major components of the airplane were located at the accident site. The engine was partially buried in in a crater that was 5 ft deep by 8 ft wide. The engine was severely damaged by impact forces, and crankshaft continuity and cylinder compression could not be confirmed due to internal impact damage. &#x0D;\nThe magneto key was broken off in the switch and set on “Both.” Both magnetos separated from the engine during the accident sequence, were damaged by impact forces, and could not be functionally tested. The spark plugs were impact damaged but showed minimal wear when compared to the Champion Check-A-Plug chart and did not display any evidence of carbon or lead fouling. &#x0D;\nThe propeller blades separated from the hub during the impact sequence. One blade was buried in the impact crater, while the opposing blade was found 30 feet west of the main wreckage. The buried blade exhibited a significant bend with chordwise scraping and leading-edge gouges. The opposing blade had a slight bend, and also exhibited chordwise scraping. The propeller hub showed rotational crushing damage. There was no evidence of an inflight fire. &#x0D;\nThe flight control system components from the cockpit to all control surfaces were significantly damaged or destroyed by impact forces and the post-impact fire. Flight control continuity could not be established; however, all observed breaks of the flight control cables displayed fracture features that were indicative of tensile overload (having “broomstraw” appearances consistent with impact-related separation). The elevator trim was measured and correlated to about 5° of trim tab deflection in the nose down direction. The rudder, left horizontal stabilizer, and elevator remained attached to the empennage, and were free to move when manually manipulated. &#x0D;\nThe cockpit was destroyed by impact forces and fire, and no flight instrumentation or gauges could be identified or recovered.

The airplane’s left main landing gear collapsed, and the airplane sustained substantial damage that included damage to the left wing. &#x0D;\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast data showed that the airplane crossed the runway approach end with a ground speed of approximately 113 kts during calm wind conditions. The airplane’s ground speed was approximately 70 kts about 4,000 ft down the runway when it began to veer off the runway. The Piper Aircraft PA-30 Owner’s Handbook states that the final approach speed for the airplane is 100 mph (86.9 kts). The bounce during landing was consistent with an excessive touchdown speed after a final approach flown at a speed higher than that specified for the airplane.&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that was no mechanical malfunction/failure of the airplane that would have precluded normal airplane operation.",

The pilot received serious injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot’s family, the flight was to depart in the morning from Taylor Municipal Airport (TYL), Taylor, Arizona, with a destination of Glendale Municipal Airport (GEU), Glendale, Arizona. The TYL airport manager reported that when he arrived at the airport that morning, he saw the airplane on the parking ramp with the engine running. The airplane’s windshield was partly covered with frost as it began to taxi in the parking ramp area. He thought that the pilot may have been taxiing into the sun to melt the frost that had covered the airplane. He further reported that it is quite common that the airplanes are moved on the ramp in the morning to melt the frost before flight. The airport manager went inside to his office and shortly after received a call on the radio from an airplane flying over the airport that an airplane had crashed on the runway.&#x0D;\nThe postaccident examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted near the centerline of the runway about midfield in an inverted, nose down attitude, then came to rest inverted on the left side of the runway. A photo of the accident site minutes after the accident revealed that the upper surfaces of the horizontal stabilizers was covered in frost.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1-Accident site, aircraft empennage and frost covering the upper surfaces of the horizontal stabilizer.

    "FactualNarrative": "On December 04, 2023, about 1250 Hawaii-Aleutian standard time, a Diamond DA-40 airplane, N691YW, sustained substantial damage when it was involved in an accident in Kapolei, Hawaii. The pilot sustained minor injuries, and the designated pilot examiner sustained serious injuries. The airplane was operated by the pilot as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 flight test.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that an engine run-up inspection was completed without any issues of concern before departure. They departed from Danial K Inouye International Airport (PHNL) Honolulu, Hawaii, about 1235. After departure they leveled off at 1,500 ft mean sea level and proceeded to the practice area to conduct an evaluation for an airplane instrument rating. The pilot configured the airplane for the first maneuver. When he moved the throttle control lever forward, they heard a “pop” sound come from the engine, followed by a rumbling noise and an airplane vibration. The pilot pulled the throttle back to its original position in an attempt to stop the rumbling and vibrations and turned the airplane back toward runway 11 at Kalaeloa Airport (PHJR), Kapolei, Hawaii, for an emergency landing. They scanned the ignition, control levers, fuel selector, and multi-function display. The pilot confirmed that the mixture control lever was full forward, the propeller control lever was full forward, and the throttle control lever was about 3/4 full forward. The ignition was positioned on \"BOTH\", the fuel selector knob was positioned directly over the right tank, and the multi-function display showed no discrepancies in engine instrument readings that would indicate a need for immediate corrective action. The airplane started a descent without any manual pitch adjustments. They increased the throttle lever to the full forward position, but this did not provide any additional thrust from the engine. They declared an emergency; the designated pilot examiner took the flight controls, and they began to look for a suitable area for a forced landing. &#x0D;\nThey performed a forced landing to a flat area of land that was covered with dirt. After initial touchdown, the airplane continued to roll straight down the dirt path until it impacted a dirt hill, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings.&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination conducted by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector and a certified airframe and powerplant mechanic revealed no internal failure of the engine. The fuel injection servo control was in the full throttle position and the mixture control was in the full rich position; neither cable could be moved in the cockpit due to impact damage. The fuel injection servo was removed for inspection, and it revealed that the throttle/butterfly did not move and was in the full-throttle position.&#x0D;\nThe valve covers and lower sparkplugs were removed; no anomalies were noted. No obstructions were observed in the fuel system. The air filter was removed with no obstruction observed. Internal baffling in the exhaust muffler had broken loose and had blocked about 3/4 of the opening. &#x0D;\nThe last 100-hour inspection was completed on November 15, 2023, with the engine total time of 2,290.5 hours -",

The flight instructor and a private pilot were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe private pilot held a single-engine land rating and was receiving instruction in the multiengine airplane. According to preliminary information obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration, the flight departed Huntsville International Airport (HSV), Huntsville, Alabama, about 1058, and proceeded northwest to a practice area. At 1120, while the airplane was about 5,700 ft mean sea level and 18 miles northwest of HSV, the flight instructor reported “mayday” to air traffic control and that the airplane was in a spin. Radio and radar contact were subsequently lost. Review of automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B) data revealed that the airplane slowed, followed by a steep descent until the end of the data.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage came to rest flat and upright, oriented on a magnetic heading of 210°, in a harvested cottonfield. All four corners of the airplane were identified, and no debris path was observed. The nose and both engines were canted right. The landing gear and flaps remained attached and were found in the fully extended position. All four fuel tanks were breached during impact; however, their respective caps remained secured. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was confirmed from the aft rudder bellcrank to the forward bellcrank in the cockpit. Elevator control continuity was confirmed from the elevator to the base of the cockpit pedestal. Aileron control continuity was confirmed from the ailerons to the cockpit pedestal. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth engines remained attached to their respective wing. The two left propeller blades remained attached to the left propeller. One blade appeared undamaged, and the other blade was buried in mud. Both propeller blades remained attached to the right propeller. One blade was buried in mud and the other blade exhibited rearward bending and chordwise scratching.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The flight instructor and private pilot initiated a round-trip, cross-country flight. The first leg of the trip was uneventful, and at the intermediate airport, the fuel tanks were topped off for the return flight. While on final approach at the destination airport, the engine lost total power. The private pilot, who was the pilot flying, switched the fuel selector from the left main tank to the left tip tank and continued to maintain glide airspeed. Shortly after the fuel tank selector was moved, engine power began increasing; however, nearly simultaneously with this restoration of power, the airplane impacted terrain about 900 ft short of the runway threshold. The fuselage and wings sustained substantial damage.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor reported that fuel was drawn from the left and right main tanks throughout the flight, and the tip tanks were not used before the loss of engine power. The instructor recalled that, during the approach, the left and right main tanks indicated a little less than 10 gallons, and the tip tanks were indicating full; however, the fuel gauges were bobbing throughout the flight.&#x0D;\nNo fuel was observed in either the left main tank or left tip tank at the accident site. About 15 gallons of fuel was drained from the right wingtip tank and about 3 gallons were drained from the right main tank.&#x0D;\nExamination of the airplane and engine found no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\nExamination of the fuel system revealed no evidence of blockages. The left main tank was evaluated for any evidence of leakage, and none was observed. The left wingtip tank sustained impact damage and was breached near the leading edge, which likely allowed for its contents to leak at the accident site. The right main and wingtip tanks were undamaged.&#x0D;\nThe airplane owner’s manual stated the pilot should, “Avoid switching tanks at low altitude since little recovery time is available in event of an error in tank selection. To preclude making a hasty decision, and to provide continuity of flow, the selector should be changed before fuel is exhausted from the tank in use.” The owner’s manual further stated that, “The main or tip tank with the highest quantity of fuel should be selected for landing.”&#x0D;\nIt is likely that the pilots’ fuel management during the nearly 2 hour and 30-minute flight resulted in the exhaustion of the left tank fuel supply on final approach at low altitude. Had the tank with the highest quantity of fuel been selected for landing, as recommended by the owner’s manual, the fuel starvation, and subsequent momentary loss of engine power, would have been avoided.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On December 3, 2023, about 2104 central standard time, a Piper PA-32-260 airplane, N7748J, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Millington, Tennessee. The private pilot was not injured, and the flight instructor sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the flight instructor, the afternoon and evening involved a roundtrip flight from the airplane’s base airport of Millington/Memphis Airport (NQA), Millington, Tennessee, to Gulf Shores International Airport (JKA), Gulf Shores, Alabama. The private pilot was the pilot flying for both flights, as he was accumulating flight time in his airplane for insurance purposes.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor reported that the flight to JKA was uneventful, and they requested that the fixed-base operator ground personnel top off the airplane’s fuel tanks. According to a fuel receipt, 40.3 gallons of fuel were added to the airplane and a top-off was noted.&#x0D;\nThe flight departed for NQA at 1832 and cruised uneventfully at 4,500 ft mean sea level. While enroute, the pilots switched between the left and right main fuel tanks and did not use the wingtip tanks during cruise. During the approach to land, the before-landing check was completed and the fuel selector was positioned to the left main tank. The instructor recalled that, during the approach, the left and right main inboard tanks indicated a little less than 10 gallons, and the wingtip tanks were indicating full; however, the fuel gauges were “bobbing” throughout the flight.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor further reported that, about 500 ft above ground level on final approach to runway 22 with full flaps, the engine suddenly “went quiet” and lost all power. The private pilot continued to fly the airplane, and the flight instructor stated, “best glide” airspeed, which the private pilot continued to maintain. Subsequently, the fuel selector was moved from the left main tank position to the left wingtip tank. Shortly after the fuel tank selector was moved, engine power began increasing; however, nearly simultaneously with this restoration of power, the airplane impacted terrain about 900 ft short of the runway threshold. The private pilot’s statement was consistent with the flight instructor’s description of the loss of engine power and collision with terrain.&#x0D;\nAccording to a Federal Aviation Administration inspector who examined the airplane at the accident site, the fuselage and wings sustained substantial damage. There was no fuel located in either the left main tank or left wingtip tank. About 15 gallons of fuel was drained from the right wingtip tank and about 3 gallons was drained from the right main tank.&#x0D;\nExamination of the airplane and engine found no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nThe fuel system was evaluated for blockages, with none observed. The left main tank was evaluated for any evidence of leakage, with none observed. The left wingtip tank sustained impact damage and was breached near the leading edge. The right main and wingtip tank were undamaged.&#x0D;\nAccording to the owner’s manual, the airplane was equipped with two inboard main wing fuel tanks that each held 25 gallons, and two outboard wingtip tanks that held 17 gallons of fuel. A fuel selector located on the floor center section of the cockpit enabled a selection of each tank individually, in addition to an OFF position. Fuel was delivered from the tank selected directly to the engine. &#x0D;\nThe owner’s manual stated that the unusable fuel was about one pint per fuel tank. The owner’s manual further stated with regard to fuel management:&#x0D;\nAvoid switching tanks at low altitude since little recovery time is available in event of an error in tank selection. To preclude making a hasty decision, and to provide continuity of flow, the selector should be changed before fuel is exhausted from the tank in use.&#x0D;\nThe owner’s manual stated that, “The main or tip tank with the highest quantity of fuel should be selected for landing.”&#x0D;\nAccording to the airplane flight manual, one of the placards required to be installed in the airplane stated,  “USE MAIN TANKS FIRST.” This placard was present in the accident airplane’s cockpit. -",

After flying for about an hour, when the airplane was about 6 miles from the Manitowoc County airport (MTW) at an altitude of about 3,000 ft above ground level (agl), the engine lost power. The pilot then made a turn towards MTW to attempt to land at the airport. The airplane was unable to maintain sufficient altitude and the pilot elected to make a forced landing in a wooded area about 2 miles south of MTW. The airplane impacted terrain and came to rest inverted. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, empennage, and both wings.&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector that responded to the accident site stated that the fuel tanks were breached but there was evidence of fuel on scene.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was retained for further examination.",

The airline transport pilot and a commercial pilot were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 positioning flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilots, shortly after being cleared for landing on runway 3R, they performed the landing configuration and before landing checks and no abnormalities were observed; the landing gear position lights indicated three green and no red. A normal landing was made in the touchdown zone, but shortly after, during the rollout, there was a “violent” left yaw and directional control was lost. The pilot used full right rudder deflection and aileron to keep the airplane centered on the runway; simultaneously, the landing gear unsafe horn sounded. The red left landing gear light illuminated, and the left green light extinguished. The airplane came to rest about 3,800 ft down the runway with the left wing partially resting on grass adjacent to the runway. &#x0D;\nThe left landing gear was collapsed, and the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and flight control surfaces. &#x0D;\nThe airplane was recovered to a secure hangar for further examination.

The 119 passengers and crew onboard were uninjured. One ramp personnel sustained minor injuries. The flight was operating as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 scheduled domestic passenger flight from OGG to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, Hawaii.&#x0D;\nThe flight crew reported that after push back from the gate, they received clearance from the tug driver to start the engines. The number one (left) engine was successfully started, the brakes set, and the ground crew was instructed to disconnect the tow bar. While waiting for load closeout and an air route traffic control clearance, the number two (right) engine was successfully started, and the ground crew was released to disconnect the headset and nose landing gear bypass pin. The captain confirmed the pin had been disconnected, the after-start checklist was completed, and a taxi clearance was received from ATC. The taxi commenced followed by an unusual motion as the airplane impacted the tow tractor.&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that after push back, the disconnect agent disconnected the tow bar from the airplane, and the tow tractor was moved to the left side of the airplane by the tow tractor driver while waiting for the all clear signal from the flight crew. The disconnect agent remained near the front of the airplane and attempted to show the nose landing gear bypass pin to the pilots while the tow tractor driver sounded the vehicle’s horn to gain the flight crews attention. Subsequently, the airplane began to move, the tow tractor driver attempted to move the tractor away from the path of the airplane while the disconnect agent vacated the area towards the terminal. The airplane impacted the tow tractor with the left wing collapsing the cab of the tow tractor. Airport fire and rescue responded to the scene and extricated the driver who was transported to the local hospital for treatment. &#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the airplane revealed minor damage to the left wing. &#x0D;\nThe following NTSB specialists were assigned to investigate the incident: operations, cockpit voice recorder (CVR), and flight data recorder (FDR). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Hawaiian Airlines, The Boeing Company, and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) are parties to the investigation.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe FDR and the CVR were removed from the airplane and shipped to the NTSB’s Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for download of the data. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe investigation continues.",

    "FactualNarrative": "On November 28, 2023, about 1031 central standard time, a Piper PA-28-181, N8274H, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Minneapolis, Minnesota. The pilot received minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he departed from Crystal Airport (MIC), near Minneapolis, Minnesota, about 0710. He noted that he departed with full fuel (48 gallons) onboard. He then flew the airplane to Watertown Regional Airport (ATY), near Watertown, South Dakota, a flight which he said took about 2 hours due to a headwind encountered along the route. He performed a touch-and-go landing at ATY and then proceeded back toward MIC, which he said took about 1hour 15 minutes due to a tailwind. Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data confirmed that the flight lasted 3 hours and 26 minutes. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that during the flight he switched the selected fuel tank every 30 minutes and noted that the airplane was equipped with a fuel timer to remind the pilot when to switch the fuel tanks. As he approached MIC, he contacted the control tower and was given instructions for sequencing to land on runway 14. When he turned onto a right base for runway 14, the engine lost partial power momentarily. He stated that he pushed the throttle control forward and the engine power was restored. He then started the turn to the final approach for runway 14 and the engine lost all power. The pilot noted that the engine had remained under power for 30 seconds to one minute following the momentary power loss before it lost all power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot notified the tower controller of his engine issues and began emergency procedures that included switching fuel tanks, turning the magnetos off and back on, checking that the primer was locked, checking the throttle was full forward and the mixture was rich, turning on the fuel pump, and applying carburetor heat. These procedures were unsuccessful in restoring engine power, and he executed a forced landing to a road. During the forced landing the airplane struck a powerline and a vehicle, which resulted in substantial damage to the wing and fuselage. The driver of the vehicle received minor injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane shortly after the accident revealed that the left fuel tank was not compromised but the tank drain was leaking fuel. The left fuel tank did not contain any usable fuel. The leakage rate from the left fuel tank drain was not determined. Removal of the fuel tank drain revealed that the o-ring seal was deformed and gouged. The right fuel tank contained an undetermined amount of usable fuel. Subsequent examination revealed no other anomalies that would have prevented normal engine operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen queried after the accident, the pilot reported that the airplane was operating on the right fuel tank when the initial and subsequent power losses occurred. He stated that he switched from the right fuel tank to the left fuel tank during the troubleshooting procedures he attempted. He noted that the engine did not continue windmilling and the propeller stopped. He stated that he attempted to restart the engine by engaging the starter once and the propeller turned but then stopped again. At that point, he focused on the forced landing. -",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On November 27, 2023, about 1748 central standard time, a Piper PA-32R-301T, N4187Q, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Attalla, Alabama. The private pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot was on an instrument flight rules clearance from Scott Municipal Airport (SCX), Oneida, Tennessee, to H L Sonny Callahan Airport (CQF), Fairhope, Alabama.&#x0D;\nAccording to preliminary Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) data and air traffic control audio information, after takeoff the flight continued on a south-southwest ground track flying at an altitude of about 6,000 ft mean sea level (msl). The pilot remained in contact with several FAA air traffic control facilities appropriate for the route of flight. While the pilot was in contact with the Birmingham Air Traffic Control Tower South Radar position the airplane began descending about 1743. At that time the airplane was about 4 nautical miles north-northeast from the approach end of runway 18 at Northeast Alabama Regional Airport (GAD), Gadsden, Alabama. At 1743:08, then again at 1743:22, the pilot contacted the controller but there was no reply until 1743:33. Two seconds later the pilot advised the controller, “…I have lost um my rpm on my engine and so um I am declaring an emergency.” The controller advised the pilot there was an airport to his right at 12 miles and an airport at 30 miles. Shortly after declaring an emergency the airplane turned right to a westerly ground track, and while on that track the pilot recognized that the flight was close to GAD and asked about it. The controller advised him that the long runway (6/24) was closed and the short runway (18/36) did not have any runway lights. While on a westerly track the pilot again questioned the controller about GAD and was again informed of the runway closure and that runway 18/36 “has got work on it as well with no lights.”&#x0D;\nAt 1744:58, the pilot asked the controller for the heading to the closest airport and was given radar vectors to Robbins Field Airport (20A), Oneonta, Alabama. The airplane remained on the westerly track until 1745:43. While flying at an altitude of about 3,300 ft msl the airplane turned left to a south-southwesterly heading. The airplane continued descending on its same track, then at 1746:04 the pilot informed the controller that the airplane was at 3,000 ft msl, which was within about 10 ft of the ADS-B reported altitude. About 26 seconds later the pilot advised the controller that he did not have any airport in sight. The airplane continued and the last ADS-B target was recorded at 1746:36, when the airplane was at about 2,400 ft msl. At 1747:32, the controller advised the pilot that radar contact was lost and asked if the pilot had a nearby highway in sight to which he replied “I” but the rest of the comment was unintelligible. At 1748:02, which was the last recorded transmission from the pilot, he advised the controller that he had a terrain warning and that the airplane was at 1,100 ft msl. The controller responded 1 minute 18 seconds later asking the pilot if he had put in the coordinates or identifier to navigate to the vectored airport.&#x0D;\nA witness who was located 1,083 ft north-northeast from the accident site reported hearing an airplane flying low then heard an explosion and felt it shake the house. A second witness who was located 2,020 ft northeast of the accident site reported seeing a fireball after the accident. A security camera located 3,965 ft and northwest from the accident site location depicted the airplane flying from left to right in a slight descent. A large fireball was recorded at 1748:10. The video did not contain sound.&#x0D;\nOn the date and time of the accident, there were NOTAMs noting that runways 6/24 and 18/36 at GAD were closed.&#x0D;\nThe accident site location which consisted of mountainous wooded terrain was about 11 nautical miles and east of 20A. Postaccident examination of the engine revealed the left gear retainer assembly (part number LW-19096) was fractured and pieces of the cushions from it were found in the oil sump. Also, the left crankshaft idler gear assembly (part number 71668) and the fuel pump idler gear assembly (part number 71664) exhibited damaged or missing teeth. The fractured pieces of the left gear retainer assembly, damaged gears, and ferrous parts found in the engine oil sump were retained for further examination.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was landing at his destination airport when the airplane veered to the left after touchdown. . The pilot attempted to correct the movement and turn the airplane back to the runway centerline with the addition of power and right rudder inputs, but the airplane then veered to the right and departed the right side of the runway. &#x0D;\nThe pilot did not recall experiencing any mechanical anomalies with the brakes during the accident flight and observed normal resistance during the landing. Postaccident examination of the brake system revealed that the right brake master cylinder failed to release pressure twice during testing and the piston had to be manually lifted before the cylinder would release pressure, which the pilot was unlikely to have been able to do during landing. The seized brake master cylinder was likely due to a deformed return spring that had bowed at some point during its service life. The manufacturer reported that the failure of the cylinder to release pressure would have resulted in a locked brake. &#x0D;\nAlthough the pilot could not recall if he applied brakes, both his and the witness’ recollection that the airplane abruptly turned right and departed the runway suggests that he may have applied right brake as the airplane was veering left. During this time the piston likely failed to release pressure due to the faulty return spring, which resulted in a runway excursion.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On November 27, 2023, about 1305 Pacific standard time, a Cessna 170B, N170HT, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Cameron Park, California. The pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, he completed four successful full-stop landings at a nearby airport before he returned to his home airport, Cameron Park Airport (O61). During his landing attempt at O61 the airplane touched down normally and immediately veered to the left. The pilot attempted to correct the movement by adding power and rudder input, but the airplane then veered to the right and departed the right side of the runway. He could not recall if he used brakes when he was trying to correct the movement. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. &#x0D;\nA witness reported that he was about midfield and heard the airplane before it came into his field of view. As the airplane came into his field of view, he heard the engine power increase and then saw the main landing gear touch down with the tail wheel still in the air. The airplane then veered right, and the right main landing gear impacted a dirt berm before the airplane came to rest in an upright position. &#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot’s operating handbook (POH), the airplane was equipped with conventional toe-type brake pedals at the top of the rudder pedals. Two brake master cylinders were mounted directly to the pilot’s hydraulic brake pedals. The POH states that the brakes are actuated by applying toe pressure to the pilot’s rudder pedals. This movement actuates the master brake cylinders, which results in a braking action on the main landing gear wheels. &#x0D;\nAccording to the master brake cylinder section of the illustrated part’s catalogue, the cylinder is comprised of a piston rod and a piston return spring accompanied by securing hardware, O-rings, and sleeves. &#x0D;\nExamination of the brake system revealed no mechanical anomalies with the right and left main landing gear brake calipers. The left brake master cylinder functioned normally when tested while the right brake master cylinder was tested twice and failed to release pressure. The piston had to be manually raised before the cylinder would release pressure. Disassembly of the right brake master cylinder revealed that the piston return spring was deformed (bowed). According to the manufacturer, the failure of the cylinder to release pressure would have resulted in a locked brake.&#x0D;\nA review of the airplane maintenance records from 2002 to the date of the accident showed that the airplane was involved in an incident that required a repair of the pilot-side right brake master cylinder attachment area by installing a doubler on June 20, 2015. The endorsement also showed that the shafts of both brake master cylinders were replaced along with O-rings. The pilot-side left brake master cylinder was subsequently replaced on July 13, 2016. There was no maintenance requirement for the return spring to be inspected or replaced, nor was there any indication in the maintenance records that the return spring had ever been replaced. Federal Aviation Regulations Part 43 Appendix D lists “brakes – for improper adjustment” as required inspection items for annual and 100-hour inspections. &#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that the brakes felt normal when he tested them before the accident flight. He also noted that he felt resistance on the brakes and that neither were mushy when he activated them upon touchdown and lost directional control of the airplane. He had also completed a full-stop landing at the nearby airport he flew to before to the accident and did not observe any issues with the brakes when he applied them. -",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On November 26, 2023, about 1000 eastern standard time, a Socata TBM 700, N850JH was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Ludington, Michigan. The pilot and pilot rated passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nAn instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed before the flight to fly from Mason County Airport (LDM) in Ludington, Michigan, to Tri-State Steuben County Airport (ANQ) in Angola, Indiana. The pilot also obtained an electronic weather briefing on the morning of the accident.  &#x0D;\nAccording to the airport manager, he assisted the pilot and pilot rated passenger in removing the airplane from a hangar on the airfield about 945. The airport manager reported that about 10 to 15 minutes later, the pilot taxied the airplane onto runway 8 and began the take-off roll. The airport manager said that the take-off appeared to be unremarkable except that the left wing dipped after rotation and the airplane continued to climb in a left bank. He watched the airplane until it disappeared into the clouds. The airport manager reported that it was snowing before and during the departure. According to an Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR) for LDM, the weather at the time of the accident was ¾ mile visibility, 400 ft cloud ceiling, and snow.&#x0D;\nA witness walking her dog about ½ mile north of the airport reported that she saw an airplane flying low overhead. The airplane was over the tree line with the left wing  perpendicular to the ground. The airplane disappeared behind the trees, and she heard a loud crash. &#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted a grassy area covered in mud and snow about ¼ mile north of Mason County Airport. A 10-foot tall, barbed wire fence, located east of the main wreckage exhibited torn and frayed wire. The airplane traveled about 110 ft from the impact site to the main wreckage and came to rest on its right side on a heading of about 120°. A crater about 10 inches deep and 36 inches long contained pieces of the left fuel tank and landing gear door and was located just west of the barbed wire fence. &#x0D;\nThe debris field, which was about 75 ft in length and 40 ft wide, was situated on an east to west heading and consisted of additional pieces of the left fuel tank, fragmented pieces of the left flap, left fuel tank sending unit, left wing root, one propeller blade, and left-wing tip. Most of the left wing was at the end of the debris field just before the main wreckage.&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage consisted of the engine, propeller hub, remaining propeller blades, fuselage, right wing, empennage, landing gear, and left aileron. All five composite propeller blades were impact separated at the hub. The hub was still attached to the gear box. Only one propeller blade was found in the debris field. The pieces of the propeller that were still attached at the hub, were ragged with a broom straw appearance cut at a 45°angle and packed with mud. The right aileron was still attached to the right wing. The landing gear was found in the up position. The left aileron trim was still attached to the left aileron and was in a neutral position. The G1000 flight deck, other avionics, and circuit breaker panel were consumed by post-impact fire. &#x0D;\nThe empennage included the vertical stabilizer, rudder, horizontal stabilizer, and elevator; however, the empennage was impact separated from the rest of the fuselage. The both the left and right elevator trim tabs showed an identical deflection, 1 cm down from the elevator main trailing edge. The rudder trim was set to close to the neutral position, .2 cm to the right. &#x0D;\nThe airplane wreckage was retained for further examination.",

The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Titel 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nAccording to a family member, the occupants were travelling from Los Cruces International Airport (LRU), Los Cruces, New Mexico, to the Bulverde Airpark (1TT8), Bulverde, Texas. Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recorded the airplane as it departed LRU at 1100 central standard time. While enroute, the airplane operated at varying altitudes, from about 3,400 ft mean sea level (msl) to about 9500 ft msl, and about 85 miles per hour (MPH) to about 170 MPH. The airplane initially passed the Ft. Stockton-Pecos County Airport (FST), Fort Stockton, Texas, but then turned 180° and returned to FST. After a 34-minute stop the airplane departed FST generally to the east. ADS-B captured the airplane maneuvering southeast of Reagan County Airport (E41), Big Lake, Texas, before it turned northwest and arrived at E41 at 1539. At 1820, ADS-B data recorded the airplane airborne again, travelling northeast. The last ADS-B data point recorded the airplane about 12 nautical miles northwest of Mertzon, Texas, at 3,400 ft and 148 MPH.&#x0D;\nAccording to the Irion County Sheriff, his office was contacted around 1836, by a 911 emergency services operator, who had received an Apple Crash alert. A search was initiated, and the wreckage was located the following morning. &#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest inverted, on a heading of about 300° magnetic.  An area of flattened trees and vegetation was observed extending back from the airplane 200 ft on a bearing of 029° to the first point of probable impact (FPPI), a gouge in a Juniper tree about 4 ft above ground level (agl). Numerous components of the airplane were found strewn along the ground scar. &#x0D;\nAn on-scene examination of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operations. The airplane was recovered to a secure facility.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On November 22, 2023, at 1646 eastern standard time, a Cirrus SR22T, N17DT, was involved in an accident near Fairland, Indiana. The airplane was destroyed. The flight instructor and pilot were fatally injured. The airplane was operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as an instructional flight.&#x0D;\nA witness who was traveling eastbound on I-74 saw a small airplane to her left flying over a field southbound. The witness stated that the airplane was very low and looked stalled or as if it was hovering or hanging. The witness estimated the airplane’s altitude as 200 ft above ground level. As the airplane approached the witness’s position, it took a sharp turn to the left or east. Immediately after turning east, the airplane seemed to lose all control. The left wing dipped, and the airplane was fully sideways; the wings were vertical. The airplane rotated to the right with the wings vertical. The witness thought that the airplane rotated to the left one more time and then leveled out extremely low to the ground. The airplane disappeared behind trees at an estimated altitude of 50-100 ft above ground level. A second or two after disappearing behind the trees, the witness saw a fireball and thick black smoke. The witness stated that no parts came off the airplane and there was no deployment of the rocket from the airplane’s parachute system before the airplane’s impact with the ground.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane revealed that it was destroyed by impact forces and postcrash fire. The main wreckage was in a corn field and included the fuselage, wings, empennage, and engine. The airplane was oriented on a tail to nose southwesterly heading. The main wreckage was about 40 ft from a ground scar that exhibited impressions of the left and right wing leading edges with an airplane nose impression in the center of both wing impressions. The nose impression contained propeller blades. There were marks consistent in shape with propeller slash marks near the outermost area of the right wing impression.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the flight control system confirmed continuity. The wing flap jack screw extension equated to fully retracted wing flaps. The aileron trim was neutral. The elevator motor extension could not be determined due to impact damage.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was retained for further examination.",

During the go-around, the witnesses observed the airplane’s left wing dip perpendicular to the ground and enter a near-vertical descent. Several surveillance cameras also captured the landing, go-around, climb, wing dip, and descent toward terrain. &#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted a shopping center parking lot about 0.25 mile west of the departure end of the runway. A post-impact fire ensued and spread to an unoccupied vehicle. The airplane was destroyed by the fire. &#x0D;\nThe main wreckage came to rest inverted. The engine separated from the fuselage and the engine and propeller were embedded about 2 ft into the ground just north of the main wreckage. Both wings remained attached to the fuselage and exhibited leading edge accordion crush damage consistent with a nose low impact. Black rubber transfer and broken pavement, consistent with the landing gear being extended, were located on the pavement at the accident site.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

The flight instructor and student pilot sustained no injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor reported that about 1425 PST, they were departed from Pearson Field Airport (VUO), Vancouver, Washington to practice steep-turns and slow flight maneuvers, to include an introduction to power-off stalls and recovery. At about 3,500 ft mean sea level (msl), the instructor executed an additional stall maneuver, and as the instructor released the back pressure on the yoke and advanced the throttle setting to full to recover, the airplane’s power setting remained at idle. The instructor subsequently increased the throttle setting incrementally after decreasing it in order to increase engine power. As the engine power remained unchanged, the instructor made the decision to execute an emergency landing. The instructor maneuvered the airplane to a nearby field and shortly after touchdown, the nose landing gear separated, and the airplane nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the aft fuselage.  &#x0D;\nThe airplane and engine were recovered to a secure facility for further examination.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Shortly after departing on the instructional flight, the pilot receiving instruction noted the rudder pedals moving back and forth without his input. The flight instructor assumed control of the airplane, also felt the rudder pedals moving, and chose to return to the airport. The oscillation of the rudder pedals intensified, the airplane began to shake violently, and the windscreen separated from the airplane. The pilots declared an emergency and subsequently landed uneventfully at the departure airport. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the rudder trim control rod end was fracture separated near the trim tab attachment point. Metallurgical examination revealed fatigue cracking parallel to the clevis attachment bolt. The overall fracture was consistent with fatigue crack growth from bending loads on the fitting where the bending moment’s axis was parallel to the clevis attachment bolt axis. It is likely that buckling of the control rod end produced the fatigue crack initiation and propagation. The fracture surface appeared free of any substantial long-term oxidation from a preexisting crack, suggesting that the fracture likely occurred due to repeated, high-compressive loads associated with the reported rudder trim flutter condition, and was secondary to the flutter condition, not the cause.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlutter is governed by aircraft speed, structural stiffness, and mass distribution. An increase in airspeed, a reduction in structural stiffness, or a change in mass distribution can increase the susceptibility to flutter. Review of maintenance records revealed that maintenance had been performed on the rudder trim tab hardware about one month before the accident flight. While it is likely that the flutter event developed first and resulted in the fracture of the rudder trim control rod end, the initiating event of the rudder flutter could not be determined based on the available evidence.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On November 17, 2023, about 2030 mountain daylight time, a Beech 95, N2024C, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Yuma, Arizona.

The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor reported that, after departing from the airport, the pilot receiving instruction noticed the rudder pedals moving back and forth. The instructor assumed control of the airplane, also felt the rudder pedals moving back and forth, and elected to return to the airport. =The oscillation of the rudder pedals intensified, and the airplane began to shake violently, which caused the front windscreen to separate from the airplane. The pilot receiving instruction declared an emergency while the instructor landed the airplane without incident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the rudder trim control rod end was fracture-separated near the trim tab attachment point and the forward windscreen had separated, which resulted in substantial damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rudder trim control rod end and jam nut were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC, for examination, which revealed that the rod end had fractured through the threads approximately 3 to 4 threads away from the clevis end. The upper ear of the clevis was bent and twisted, with contact damage noted on the left side of the clevis and on the threads between the clevis and the fracture surface. The forward side of the clevis showed a fractured surface with a curving arrest line, features consistent with fatigue. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used for further examination of the fatigue region. The SEM images revealed that the fatigue features emanated from a broad origin area at the root of the thread and propagated preferentially along the thread root. Course striations and secondary cracking were identified at higher magnifications and showed features consistent with a relatively high-stress, low-cycle fatigue fracture mechanism. It was also noted that the fracture surface appeared to be free of any substantial oxidation from a preexisting crack. The overall fracture appearance indicated that the fracture likely occurred due to repeated high compressive loads.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of maintenance records revealed that about a month prior to the accident flight, maintenance and been performed on the rudder trim tab hardware.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlutter is an aeroelastic phenomenon that can occur when an airplane’s natural mode of structural vibration couples with the aerodynamic forces to produce a rapid periodic motion, oscillation, or vibration. Flutter can be somewhat stable if the natural damping of the structure prevents an increase in the forces and motions. Flutter can become dynamically unstable if the damping is not adequate or speed is increased, resulting in increasing self-excited destructive forces being applied to the structure. Flutter can range from an annoying buzz of a flight control or aerodynamic surface to a violent destructive failure of the structure in a very short period of time. Due to the high frequency of oscillation, even when flutter is on the verge of becoming catastrophic, it can still be very hard to detect. Aircraft speed, structural stiffness, and mass distribution are three inputs that govern flutter. An increase in airspeed, a reduction in structural stiffness, or a change in mass distribution can increase the susceptibility to flutter. -",

The airplane departed CCR about 1734 and arrived at F70 about 2030. Due to poor weather conditions at F70 the pilot diverted to Mc Clellan-Palomar Airport (CRQ), Carlsbad, California. There was an ILS outage at CRQ, so the pilot elected to divert to Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport (MYF), San Diego, California, to fly the ILS approach.&#x0D;\nThe pilot was cleared for the ILS approach at MYF. Subsequently, the pilot reported that he was on a missed approach because he could not see the runway and requested another approach. He also advised ATC that he was running low on fuel. The airplane then maneuvered northwest of the airport, where the pilot reported that he was out of fuel before radar and communication contact were lost. &#x0D;\nA search by law enforcement located the airplane wreckage early the following morning on a hillside in a residential area about 6 miles northwest of MYF.

    "PrelimNarrative": "On November 15, 2023, about 1040 central standard time, an Xtremeair GMBH XA42, N42XM, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Union City, Tennessee. The private pilot receiving instruction and a flight instructor were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was recently purchased by the private pilot and two other pilots. The flight instructor was providing instruction to all three owners for familiarization and to meet insurance requirements. The goal was to meet the insurance requirements and increase each pilot’s individual proficiency. The other two co-owners witnessed the accident, and their description of events was consistent throughout.&#x0D;\nThe airplane departed on the accident flight from Everett-Stewart Regional Airport (UCY), Union City, Tennessee, completed traffic pattern work at a nearby airport, and returned to UCY to perform aerobatic maneuvers in the airport’s aerobatic “box.” The co-owners observed the airplane’s approach and entry into the box and described the engine sound as smooth and continuous throughout. &#x0D;\nOne of the co-owners stated that the airplane was flying north to south and was conducting an “avalanche” maneuver, which comprised a loop during which a snap roll is performed at the top. &#x0D;\nHe estimated that the airplane entered the maneuver at an altitude of about 1,200 ft above ground level (agl) and reached the top of the loop around 2,000 ft agl. He stated that, rather than completing a 360° snap roll at the top of the loop, the airplane’s roll continued through 540°, and the airplane was upright when it should have finished the roll inverted and continued through the remainder of the loop. By this time, the airplane had slowed considerably, the engine was at full power, and the gyroscopic effect of the propeller pulled the nose down, with no airspeed, and the airplane entered a spin. Once in the spin, the rotation stopped, then the airplane entered a secondary spin and descended to ground contact. He estimated that the airplane descended in a nose-down attitude of about 75°. &#x0D;\nThe other co-owner stated that the engine “sounded great” as the airplane entered the avalanche maneuver. During the snap roll, “the nose did an extra rotation in the roll axis,” and the airplane stopped upright and yawed to the left. He stated that it was possible that the airplane entered a “gyroscopic tumble” before entering a 1.25-turn spin. The airplane recovered from the spin about 500 ft agl, and the co-owner speculated that the pilots may have, “tried to pull out there,” before the airplane entered another spin. When asked, the co-owner said that the engine was running “at full power,” but that once the spin was fully developed, he could not recall what the engine sound was.&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) third class medical certificate was issued on May 23, 2022. He reported 650 total hours of flight experience on that date. Initial examination of excerpts from the pilot’s logbook could not reconcile his total experience; however, 6 flights totaling 8 hours of experience in the accident airplane were recorded between November 1 and 14, 2023.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor held an airline transport pilot certificate with multiple type ratings and a flight instructor certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine, multiengine, and instrument airplane. His most recent FAA first class medical certificate was issued on July 25, 2023. He reported 6,800 total hours of flight experience on that date. His pilot logbook was located and his total flight experience in the accident airplane make and model was not determined.&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA and maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 2015 and was powered by a Lycoming AEIO-580-B1A, 315-horsepower engine. The airplane’s most recent annual inspection was completed on November 3, 2023, at 57 total aircraft hours. &#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest upright on flat terrain in a solar farm on the west side of UCY. The airplane rested in its initial impact crater on a 325° heading, consistent with the vertical descent described by the witnesses and as viewed in surveillance video. &#x0D;\nThe front and rear cockpit areas were deformed, and the composite structure was fractured throughout. The wings were fractured and partially separated at their roots, but attached by structure, wires, and push-pull tubes. The empennage remained largely intact. The vertical and horizontal stabilizers, rudder, and elevator were all damaged by impact. Flight control continuity could not be established initially because the controls were impinged against structure by upward impact forces. Once the airplane was lifted, and as wings and structure was separated, flight control continuity was confirmed from the flight controls, through several breaks, to the flight control surfaces. All fractures were consistent with impact and overstress fracture. &#x0D;\nBoth main fuel tanks, the “Acro” fuel tank, and the fuel header tank were breached by impact and did not contain fuel. Fuel was ponded in the impact depression beneath the left wing.&#x0D;\nThe engine was partially buried in its impact crater. Two of the three propeller blades were fractured at their roots. All three blades showed chordwise smearing (mud). Once lifted, the engine starter case showed rotational smearing and scoring in the approximate arc of the starter ring gear.&#x0D;\nThe engine oil sump was fractured and destroyed by impact. The fuel servo was separated by impact but remained attached by cabling and fuel lines. The inlet screen was removed, contained fuel, and was absent of water and debris. &#x0D;\nThe engine was separated from the airframe and examined at the scene. The crankshaft was rotated by hand at the propeller, and continuity was confirmed through the powertrain and valvetrain to the accessory section. Compression was confirmed on each cylinder using the thumb method. The magnetos were secure in their mounts, but damaged by impact. They were removed, rotated by an electric drill, and each produced spark at all terminal leads.&#x0D;\nThe fuel selector handle was mounted in the aft cockpit and was connected to the fuel selector valve by a control tube. The valve was mounted near the engine firewall. The control tube was fractured, and the handle moved freely in its mount. The valve was removed, and compressed air flowed freely from the “Acro” inlet port to the engine outlet port. The left main and right main ports were occluded.&#x0D;\nAn engine data monitor and a GPS were retained and forwarded to the NTSB Recorders Laboratory in Washington, DC.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On November 14, 2023, at 1409 eastern standard time, a Piper PA-28-180, N7806W, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Micanopy, Florida. The private pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to preliminary air traffic control (ATC) communications, prior to departure, the ground controller at Kissimmee Gateway Airport (ISM), Orlando, Florida, reported that the weather conditions were “IFR” indicating the ceiling was broken clouds at 800 ft above ground level (agl). About 1 minute later the controller stated there were updated weather conditions, which were few clouds at 800 ft agl, then issued a taxi clearance for the airplane. According to automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B) data, the airplane departed ISM about 1245.   &#x0D;\nADS-B flight track data indicated that after departure, the airplane flew on a northerly track until about 1333, when a brief turn towards the east was observed, which was followed by a left turn back to a northerly heading. Subsequently, the airplane performed several erratic 360° turns, as well as numerous climbs and descents to a maximum altitude of 6,900 ft mean sea level (msl) and a minimum altitude of 500 ft msl, between 1335 and 1409 prior to losing radar contact. The rate of descent was in excess of 5,000 ft per minute for the final data point. The main wreckage was located about 650 ft northeast of the final ADS-B data point (see Figure 1). &#x0D;\nPreliminary review of air traffic control communications revealed that during the erratic maneuvering, the pilot called \"mayday\" and stated he \"was lost in weather.\" During this period, the pilot reported multiple times that he was having issues with his instruments, he \"mistakenly flew into weather,” \"it's completely white,” and he could not see anything outside. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. View of final flight track data. Yellow line indicates the airplane flight track for the final approximate 40 minutes of flight.&#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest in a heavily wooded area at an elevation of 100 ft mean sea level. It struck several trees before impacting the sandy terrain. The airplane came to rest in a crater that was about 4 ft deep. All major components of the airplane were located in the vicinity of the main wreckage. &#x0D;\nThe fuselage was fragmented and the cabin was crushed forward. Flight control continuity was established from the cabin to all flight control surfaces through multiple cuts made by first responders and tensile overload failures. The right wing was separated from the fuselage at the wing root. The forward section of the right wing was impact crushed aft. The outboard approximate 4 ft of the right wing was impact separated and located along the debris path. The left wing was fragmented. The inboard section of the left wing was impact crushed aft. The empennage was impact separated from the fuselage. The stabilator remained attached to the empennage. The trim tab remained attached to the stabilator. The vertical stabilizer and rudder were impact separated and located in the vicinity of the main wreckage. &#x0D;\nThe attitude indicator was separated from the instrument panel and disassembled. Rotational scoring was noted on the gyroscope and the gyroscope housing. The electric turn and bank indicator was removed from the instrument panel. It was disassembled and vertical scoring was noted on the gyroscope. The compass was separated from the instrument panel. During examination, the compass float moved when the instrument was manipulated. &#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the forward section of the fuselage through all engine mounts. The crankshaft could not be rotated by hand. The propeller flange was impact bent but remained attached to the crankshaft. The rocker box covers were removed, and no anomalies were noted with the rocker arms. The cylinders were examined with a lighted borescope, sand and oil were noted in the cylinders, but no anomalies were noted. The magnetos were removed from the engine and spark was noted on all towers. All spark plugs were removed except the No. 2 bottom spark plug, which was impact damaged. The spark plugs were massive electrode type, all were light grey in color, and exhibited worn out – normal wear when compared to the Champion Check-A-Plug Chart. The carburetor was disassembled, the carburetor bowl did not contain fuel; however, the carburetor floats exhibited hydraulic deformation. The oil filter was removed from the accessory section of the engine and disassembled. No metallic debris was noted in the filter. The oil suction screen was removed from the oil sump and was not obstructed. The vacuum pump was removed from the accessory section of the engine and disassembled. The rotor and vanes remained intact, and the drive splines were intact. &#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with a two-blade, fixed pitch propeller. Tip tearing, chordwise scratching, and S-bending was noted on the propeller. Furthermore, a branch, about 2 inches in diameter, that was cut at a 45° angle was located in the vicinity of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\nPreliminary weather radar information indicated that the flight track entered an area of very light intensity precipitation echoes around 1330 at 1,100 ft and continued maneuvering on a westerly heading while remaining in light intensity echoes for the remainder of the flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration records, the pilot held a private pilot certificate. He did not hold an instrument rating. According to the pilot’s logbook, he accumulated about 66 hours of total flight time. Furthermore, he recorded 1 hour of instrument flight time and 2.2 hours of simulated instrument flight time.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On November 14, 2023, about 1008 Mountain standard time (MST), a Cessna 172G, N3971L, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Provo, Utah. Both pilots were fatally injured, and the passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe passenger reported that they were flying from Spanish Fork Municipal Airport/Woodhouse Field (SPK), Utah, to Driggs/Reed Memorial Airport (DIJ), Driggs ID. He believed that the pilot’s intent was to maneuver and to remain outside of the Provo Municipal Airport (PVU) Class D airspace as well as the Salt Lake City Class B Airspace. According to Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data (figure 1), shortly after takeoff, the airplane flew north and east of PVU and into Slate Canyon toward rising terrain. The passenger further reported that he was unable to discern any dialogue between the pilot and copilot regarding the rationale behind the pilot's decision to fly eastward into the canyon. He also noted windy conditions in the canyon, that he heard the airplane’s stall warning horn, and that the plane was in a nose-high attitude before it hit trees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nN    &#x0D;\nMain Wreckage&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. View of location of main wreckage in relation to ADS-B data track in Google Earth.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1117, the Civil Air Patrol received an emergency locator broadcast. Following a search and rescue mission, the airplane wreckage was located about 6 miles northeast of SPK on a slope of Slate Canyon, about 2,000 feet below the summit at an elevation of about 7,900 ft mean sea level (msl). The aircraft was orientated on a magnetic heading of 050° when it came to rest on a 35° slope (figure 2). The first identified point of contact (FIPC) was identified by a severed branch of 70-foot-tall aspen tree. A debris path was marked with subsequent tree strikes that began about 80 ft forward of the FIPC and oriented on a heading of 280° magnetic. The main wreckage marked the end of the debris path and was located about 170 ft beyond the FIPC. All major airplane components necessary for flight were accounted for at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2.

The pilot sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated by the pilot as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he intended to conduct a short flight to run the engine to avoid a prolonged period between flights. He completed most of the preflight items earlier in the afternoon when he cleared snow off the airplane. He returned later, unplugged the engine heater, removed the engine blanket, and completed a final preflight check. The pilot determined the airplane’s fuel tanks contained a total of about 12 to 14 gallons of fuel, about 7 gallons in each wing tank. He stated that the airplane had large non-original fuel tanks and it was difficult to measure fuel quantities under 10 gallons; he was also uncertain about how much unusable fuel each tank held.  &#x0D;\nAbout 1610, he departed runway 32 and maintained a “close in” pattern with a climb to about 800 ft mean sea level. On the downwind leg he adjusted the engine power to 1500 rpm to start the approach. On final he placed the airplane in an uncoordinated slip to increase the airplane’s rate of descent. Close to the end of the approach, the pilot further reduced power, but then recognized that he was too low on the approach. He applied engine power to arrest the descent rate; however, the engine did not respond, and he realized that the engine had lost total power. He switched the fuel selector from the left tank to the both position in an attempt to restore engine power. He realized that the airplane did not have sufficient altitude to make the runway and he performed a forced landing short of the runway. The main landing gear impacted a berm along a roadway that ran across the approach end of runway 32, resulting in substantial damage to the fuselage and left-wing strut. &#x0D;\nAfter the accident the pilot stated that the combination of low fuel state and the forward slip may have un-ported the fuel in the fuel tank resulting in the total loss of engine power.&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the left and right fuel tanks were empty. The gascolator was full of fuel and the fuel was consistent with 100LL aviation gasoline. No fuel was observed in the lines entering or exiting the gascolator. The fuel strainer was clean and contained no water.  &#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the engine was performed. The throttle, mixture, and carburetor heat controls were checked for continuity with no discrepancies noted. The top spark plugs were removed and were in serviceable condition with normal electrodes. Both magnetos and all ignition leads were checked for operation; spark was observed at each end of the top ignition lead when the crankshaft was rotated. A thumb compression check of all four cylinders verified compression. The oil level was at the correct level and no discrepancies were noted with the oil’s condition. The air filter was removed and found to be serviceable; the carburetor throat was clear of obstructions. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot reported that, just after rotation during takeoff, he began to accelerate the airplane to 120 knots. About 20 ft above the runway, he noticed that the airplane’s airspeed and altitude started to decrease, though he reported no issues with either engine. Assessing the length of runway remaining, the pilot chose to abort the takeoff and lowered the landing gear using the normal method. The airplane touched down on the runway before the gear was fully extended, and the landing gear collapsed. The airplane came to rest upright about 1,000 ft before the end of the runway and incurred substantial damage to the airplane’s wings. The pilot stated that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the landing gear, which operated satisfactorily during recovery of the airplane using the emergency extension system.&#x0D;\nThe departure runway was about 8,000 ft long. The airplane’s flight manual indicated that, given the airplane’s gross weight near its maximum and the environmental conditions present at the time of the accident, a minimum of 3,100 ft was required to accelerate, rotate, and climb to 50 ft; however, flight track data was not available to determine the maximum altitude the airplane reached during the takeoff or the point at which the pilot decided to abort the takeoff.&#x0D;\nThe pilot attributed the loss of airspeed and altitude to a microburst during takeoff. Review of weather conditions revealed that a quasi-stationary front passed through the area around the time of the accident with a resulting slight wind shift; however, there was no significant wind shear associated with the front. Additionally, no convective echoes associated with microbursts or outflow boundaries were detected in radar data or satellite imagery, and recorded weather observations did not detect any strong gusting winds until well after the accident. Thus, there was no available evidence to support that wind shear or microburst conditions existed at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\nAlthough a reason for the airplane’s degraded climb performance could not be determined, its operation near the maximum gross weight and the ambient temperature at the time of the accident were likely factors. Any delay in the pilot’s recognition of the airplane’s reduced performance and aborting the takeoff would have resulted in the airplane continuing about 200 additional feet along the runway every second.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On November 11, 2023, about 1357 eastern standard time, a Cessna 421B, N977SM, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Lake City, Florida. The commercial pilot and five passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he had landed at Lake City Gateway Airport (LCQ) to refuel the airplane, and after fueling, he performed weather and flight planning for the next leg of the flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot taxied to runway 10, an 8,003-foot-long runway, and after lining up on the runway centerline for departure, set the power and started the takeoff roll operating about 45 lbs below the airplane’s maximum gross weight. Data from an airport operations and tracking system (AOTS) captured a portion of the takeoff roll, with the airplane attaining 80 knots groundspeed about 1,544 ft down the runway. No more data points from the AOTS, or ADS-B, were available for the accident flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that, after rotation, he transitioned to a climb airspeed of 120 knots and retracted the landing gear (no information was available in the airplane’s Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] Approved Aircraft Flight Manual [AFM], airplane maintenance manual, or component maintenance manual that specified how long gear retraction or extension would take). When the airplane was about 20 ft above ground level with the engines developing normal rpm and manifold pressure, the airspeed started to decrease with a corresponding loss of altitude, which the pilot later attributed to be from a “microburst on takeoff.” He assessed the length of runway remaining versus continuing the flight and aborted the takeoff. He used the normal method to extend the landing gear, but it was not fully extended and collapsed upon touchdown. The airplane came to rest upright near the aiming point markings for runway 28. Postaccident review of pictures of the airplane revealed substantial damage in the form of abrasion to the wing carry-through structure, and damage to ribs in both wings.&#x0D;\nThe pilot also stated that he did not perceive any issue with either engine during the flight and that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the landing gear extension system. He also indicated that in the previous 90 days, in which he had flown that airplane on 40 flights accruing about 58 hours, he had not experienced any issues with the landing gear or engines.&#x0D;\nDuring recovery of the airplane from the runway, the landing gear was extended via the emergency extension system with no discrepancies reported. Safety concerns due to potential fuel leakage prevented application of electrical power to extend the gear using the normal system.&#x0D;\nAccording to the airplane’s AFM, for the existing environmental conditions that day, operating at gross weight, no wind, and a takeoff speed of 106 knots indicated airspeed, the distance to take off and climb to 50 ft was about 3,100 ft. The AFM also indicated that the calculated rate of climb performance for the temperature that day and with the flaps and landing gear up, maximum continuous power and climbing at 106 knots calibrated airspeed, was about 1,559 ft per minute and the distance to land over a 50 ft obstacle and stop was about 2,218 ft.&#x0D;\nReview of weather information indicated that an east-to-west quasi-stationary front extended in the vicinity of the accident site about the time of the accident. The surface weather observations surrounding the time of the accident depicted a slight wind shift, but there were no significant weather echoes within 5 miles of the accident site at the time of the accident. Further, there was no support for significant low-level wind shear or turbulence below 10,000 ft outside of any potential convection, and there were no Convective SIGMETs, SIGMETs, Center Weather Advisories, or Graphic-AIRMETs over the airport surrounding the period between 1400 through 1600. -",

Before departing, he tested the carburetor heat and noted that it was functioning as expected. He applied power for takeoff and the engine accelerated “strongly and smoothly.” About 25-30 ft above the ground during the initial climb the engine suddenly lost about 1,000 rpm. The pilot elected to perform an off-field landing. He maneuvered to avoid a hedgerow and the airplane touched down in an in an area of high grass. During the landing sequence, the fuselage and right wing were substantially damaged. &#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the engine and fuel system did not reveal evidence of a preexisting anomaly or failure that would have precluded normal operation. The temperature/dew point at the time of the accident was in the range for serious carburetor icing at cruise power. While the pilot described checking the functionality of the carburetor heat before as part of his normal preflight checks, and leaving it on for “a little longer” than normal as a part of that process, given all available information, it is likely that the temperature of the carburetor dropped during the extended operation of the engine while on the ground, and that during takeoff, the carburetor accumulated ice to a point that resulted in the partial loss of engine power.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On November 11, 2023, about 0815 eastern standard time, a Taylorcraft BC12-65 airplane, N29868, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Columbia, Tennessee. The private pilot incurred minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he performed a preflight inspection of the airplane and confirmed there were about 12 gallons of fuel on board. Including engine start, taxi, and pretakeoff runup operations, the engine was running for about 25 minutes with no anomalies noted. Before takeoff he activated the carburetor head and noticed a “normal” engine rpm drop. He also stated that he left the carburetor heat applied, “for a little longer” and when he turned it off there was no engine rpm change. He applied power for takeoff and the engine accelerated “strongly and smoothly.” About 25-30 ft above the ground during the initial climb, the engine suddenly lost about 1,000 rpm. The pilot elected to perform an off-field landing. He maneuvered to avoid a hedgerow and the airplane touched down in an area of high grass. During the landing sequence the airplane was substantially damaged. The pilot was met by first responders.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was examined after recovery to a storage facility. The wing and main fuel tanks contained fuel and were uncompromised. Fuel drained from the tanks was clean and free of water or other contaminants. The carburetor bowl contained a small amount of particulate matter. The carburetor inlet screen was clear. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was turned through manually by rotating the propeller. Compression and suction were noted on all four cylinders and valve action was correct. The magnetos produced spark to all leads when operated manually. The spark plugs were normal in color and wear when compared to a Champion inspection chart. The carburetor was broken from the engine consistent with impact damage; however, the cockpit controls remained attached. The carburetor heat knob was found in the “off” position. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the fuel system and engine did not reveal evidence of a preexisting anomaly or failure that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe recorded temperature and dew point near the accident site was about 48 and 35 degrees, respectively. On a carburetor icing probability chart, those temperatures were in the “serious icing – cruise power” range.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (CE-09-35) – Carburetor Icing Prevention, stated that: &#x0D;\n“…pilots should be aware that carburetor icing doesn't just occur in freezing conditions, it can occur at temperatures well above freezing temperatures when there is visible moisture or high humidity. Icing can occur in the carburetor at temperatures above freezing because vaporization of fuel, combined with the expansion of air as it flows through the carburetor, (Venturi Effect) causes sudden cooling, sometimes by a significant amount within a fraction of a second. Carburetor ice can be detected by a drop in rpm in fixed pitch propeller airplanes and a drop in manifold pressure in constant speed propeller airplanes. In both types, usually there will be a roughness in engine operation.” -",

The flight instructor and the student pilot were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 training flight.&#x0D;\nAfter a thorough pre-flight, the flight instructor started the airplane and noticed that the engine began shaking and noticed that the alternator was not charging the battery. They shut down the airplane and inspected the engine and alternator belt. Everything appeared to be normal, and they restarted the airplane, and everything “was in the green.” All systems during the run-up appeared normal. &#x0D;\nThe flight instructor and student pilot departed the Rocky Mountain Metro Airport (BJC) about 0840. After completing several maneuvers, the flight instructor gave his student pilot a simulated engine fire. After completing the appropriate checklists, they entered a simulated emergency descent about 7,000 ft. The flight instructor reported that they transitioned into a simulated emergency landing and the student pilot chose a field, taking the simulated emergency descent down to about 700 ft. As the student pilot applied full power to recover, the engine started to shake. The flight instructor took the controls and the engine RPMs started to drop. Since the engine was still running, and they were near an airport, the flight instructor maneuvered the airplane toward the airport. He set up to land on the runway but was too high and fast. Engine RPMs reduced to about 1,900 and the flight instructor decided to land the airplane in a field to avoid houses near the airport. &#x0D;\nThe flight instructor maneuvered the airplane to touch down in a field, and the landing was uneventful. However, the field was sloping, and the airplane rolled nose-first into a culvert, resulting in substantial damage to the right wing and engine firewall. The flight instructor and student pilot evacuated the airplane uninjured. &#x0D;\nAn engine examination was completed on November 11, 1023, at the operator’s facility in Englewood, CO. The examination was supervised by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, assisted by a representative from Lycoming engines, and conferenced with the NTSB IIC.&#x0D;\nThe cowling, the top spark plugs, and valve covers were removed for the examination. The engine was rotated by hand via the propeller. And compression was felt at cylinders number 1, 2, and 3. No compression was felt at the number 4 cylinder. Further examination revealed that the number 4 exhaust valve was stuck open, and the number 4 push rod was bent (See Figures 1&amp;2). The cylinder was borescope inspected and no anomalies noted. Both magnetos produced sparks at all leads when the engine was rotated. The spark plugs appeared normal as compared to the Champion Aviation check a Plug chart AV-27. All the fuel injectors were found clear. The general appearance of the engine appeared to be in good operating condition.&#x0D;\n   &#x0D;\nFigures 1&amp;2.

Testing of the fuel quantity sending unit revealed that it was inoperative.&#x0D;\nThe lack of useable fuel upon initial examination, the inoperative fuel quantity sending unit, and the loss of power to both engines is consistent with a fuel mismanagement event; however, the amount of fuel onboard at the time of the accident could not be quantified, and whether the loss of engine power was the result of fuel exhaustion or starvation could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On November 7, 2023, at 1510 eastern standard time, an Aero Commander 500B, N118PW, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Jackson, Michigan. The pilot was uninjured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 positioning flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that, about 30 minutes after departure, he began to observe “erratic/low fuel pressure” on the right engine. The pilot descended the airplane from 7,000 ft to 5,500 ft, reduced engine power, and turned the fuel boost pump on. Upon reaching 5,500 ft, fuel pressure returned to normal, and the engine produced full power. About 15 to 20 minutes later, the same engine and fuel pressure symptoms reoccurred and the pilot reduced engine power, turned the fuel boost pump on again, descended the airplane to 3,500 ft, and engine power and fuel pressure were restored. About 15 miles from the destination airport, the fuel pressure to the right engine was lost, and the right engine began surging and producing partial power. Shortly thereafter, left engine fuel pressure was lost and both engines were producing partial power: between 12 to 15 inches manifold pressure and less than 10 psi of fuel pressure. The airplane could not sustain level flight, and the pilot performed a forced landing to a field, during which the airplane sustained substantial damage to the left wing.&#x0D;\nDuring an initial postaccident examination of the airplane, only residual fuel was drained from the fuel system. A security seal was not placed over the fuel tank filler port(s), and the airplane was in the field and unmonitored until an engine run, and a subsequent airplane examination was performed on November 29, 2023at the accident site. The subsequent examination of the fuel system, which included the airframe fuel filters and flow dividers, did not reveal any debris or contaminants. About 27 gallons of 100 low lead aviation fuel was drained from the airplane after the airplane was leveled using jacks. The fuel drained did not contain contaminants. About 6 gallons of fuel was added to the fuel system; both engines started and ran without any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Testing of the fuel quantity sending unit, The Liquidometer Corp. part number EA515B-1404M, indicated full at varying levels and down to an empty level of actual fuel quantity. &#x0D;\nBench testing of the fuel boost pumps, fuel servos, and the fuel manifold valve assembly with attached lines and fuel nozzles revealed no anomalies. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Performance analysis of ADS-B data from the accident flight showed that about 20 minutes after departing, and while flying at an altitude of about 6,000 ft msl, the airplane’s speed began increasing, reaching a maximum of about 125 kts. After some subsequent variation between a low of 101 kts and a high of 120 kts, the airplane descended at a rate of 1,000 ft/min and an airspeed near 100 kts before the data ended. While the airplane’s descent and deceleration indicated a reduction in total energy consistent with a loss of thrust, it’s performance and speed were not consistent with a total loss of engine power, based on the airplane’s stated glide performance.&#x0D;\nShortly before the airplane impacted terrain, a witness described that he heard the airplane flying in the distance and that the engine sounded like it was oscillating. He looked up and saw the airplane, before it began a left circling turn, with a “white mist” trailing it. He further stated that the engine “cut out” and the airplane went “nose down” and impacted the ground. Additionally, a residential video doorbell recorded the sound of the airplane before impact, and a sound spectrum analysis of the engine/propeller sound revealed that the engine rpm likely exceeded the rated speed of 2,700 rpm during the descent.  &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that a post-impact fire destroyed most of the airframe. The wreckage displayed damage consistent with the airplane having impacted the ground at the conclusion of a near vertical descent. Flight control continuity was established to all primary flight controls through frayed cables and fractured bell cranks, and no evidence was found to suggest that there was a mechanical malfunction or failure of the airplane’s flight controls. Examination of the engine, which was limited by the extent of the thermal and impact-related damage, showed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures. Based on the available information, the reason for the airplane’s descent and impact with terrain could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\nOn October 31, 2023, at 1123 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-32-300, N44601, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Marion, Ohio. The pilot and pilot-rated passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nA witness stated he was standing outside his house when he heard an airplane flying in the distance and the engine sounded like it was oscillating. He looked up and saw the airplane flying south, before it began a left circling turn with a “white mist” trailing the airplane. He further stated that the engine “cut out” and the airplane went “nose down” and impacted the ground.&#x0D;\nA residential video doorbell recorded the sound of the airplane before the impact. The video was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Vehicle Recorders Laboratory, Washington D.C., for a sound spectrum study. It was estimated that shortly before ground impact, the engine speed significantly exceeded its rated speed of 2,700 rpm. The accurate maximum speed could not be estimated because the analysis was based on recorded propeller blade passage frequency that was affected by Doppler frequency shifts of unknown magnitude. For further information, please see the Sound Spectrum Study in the public docket for this investigation. &#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was located in an open field, about a ½-mile from a county road. The airplane impacted the ground in a steep, nose-down, near-vertical attitude. The magnetic heading was 090°. The engine and propeller were buried about 2 ft in the ground. A postimpact fire destroyed most of the airframe. The left wing displayed accordion crushing along the entire leading edge. The left wingtip fuel tank was destroyed by fire. The left aileron and flap remained attached to the wing and were partially consumed by fire. The right wing was destroyed by fire. The right wing remained attached to the left wing by the aileron crossover cable and by the flap torque tube. Flight control continuity was observed to all primary flight controls through frayed cables and fractured bell cranks. &#x0D;\nThe aileron control cables remained attached at both ends of the left and right bellcranks. The left aileron primary control cable separated near the junction with the control chain; the separated end displayed fraying and unraveling consistent with overload. The control chain was broken into several pieces. Separated ends of the aileron control chain revealed bending and fractures consistent with overload.&#x0D;\nThe manual flap selector was burned and deformed by impact forces. The flap selector was found in the 10° flaps extended position. The flap torque tube was impact damaged and the flap control chains were found off the sprockets. The right flap torque tube and control rod at the right-wing root displayed a flaps fully retracted position.&#x0D;\nThe rudder cables remained attached at the rudder horn and were continuous from that point to the rudder bar in the forward cabin. The rudder cables remained attached at the rudder bar.&#x0D;\nThe stabilator control cables were attached at the stabilator control tube and were observed to be continuous from the empennage to the control column in the forward cabin. The stabilator balance weight remained attached to the stabilator control tube.&#x0D;\nThe propeller hub was fragmented and separated from the engine flange. The intake and exhaust pipes were crushed and separated. The Nos. 2, 3 and 4 cylinders were impact damaged. The No. 1 cylinder head and valves were impact damaged. The No. 2 cylinder head was separated from the barrel and impact fragmented. The barrel remained attached to the engine crankcase. The No. 3 cylinder head and valves were impact damaged. The No. 4 cylinder, connecting rod, and piston were separated from the crankcase. A portion of the cylinder barrel flange and barrel remained attached to the crankcase. One connecting rod bolt was separated from the connecting rod and not observed. The rod was impact damaged. The No. 4 crankshaft rod journal was undamaged. No thermal discoloration or scoring of the journal surface was observed. The engine crankshaft could not be rotated by turning the propeller flange. The interiors of the cylinders, which remained attached to the engine, were observed using a lighted borescope and no anomalies were noted. Oil was observed in the engine. The oil suction screen contained ferrous and non-ferrous metallic debris.&#x0D;\nThe engine was further disassembled to facilitate the examination. The cylinders, oil sump and accessory case were removed. No damage to the cylinders, pistons or valves, other than impact damage was noted. The crankcase halves were separated and the crankshaft and camshaft removed. No damage to the crankshaft, crankshaft main journals, crankshaft bearings, or camshaft was noted. No indication of bearing thermal damage was noted. The engine oil pump was disassembled and no damage to the gears noted.&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed on samples from the pilot revealed Atorvastatin in the liver and muscle tissue. Atorvastatin is a prescription medication commonly used to control cholesterol and reduce cardiovascular risk. Atorvastatin is not generally considered impairing. &#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed on samples from the pilot-rated passenger revealed Atorvastatin, loratadine, desloratadine, and warfarin in the liver and muscle tissue. Carvedilol was detected in the muscle tissue and not the liver tissue. Carvedilol is a prescription medication that can be used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Atorvastatin, loratadine, desloratadine, warfarin, and carvedilol are not generally considered impairing.&#x0D;\nThe toxicology information for both the pilot and pilot-rated passenger provided no clear evidence of in-flight fire, and available information was not consistent with the occupants experiencing carbon monoxide poisoning; no soot was identified in the lungs. &#x0D;\nThe autopsy for both the pilot and passenger determined the cause of death to be multiple blunt force trauma. &#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nA performance study was conducted for this investigation based on ADS-B data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration. The study calculated the airplane’s airspeed and heading, among other parameters. According to the study, the airplane departed Rickenbacker International Airport (LCK) in Columbus, Ohio at 1058. The airplane climbed to 4,000 ft msl, then turned onto a northern course as it flew around Columbus to the west. It continued to climb to about 6,000 ft.&#x0D;\nAfter reaching 6,000 ft, the airplane’s airspeed increased from 108 kts at 1107 to 125 kts at 1108. After some airspeed variation, the airplane settled at an airspeed of 110 kts while at a constant altitude and a ground track of 350° from 1113 to 1119. About 1120, the airplane’s airspeed began to decrease from 108 kts to 101 kts while track and altitude remained steady. The airplane then accelerated to 120 kts while turning right onto a heading of 36°. At 1121:45, the speed began to decrease and by 1121:55 the airplane was descending at a rate of 1,000 ft/min. While descending, the airplane’s airspeed stabilized near 100 kts before the data ended at 1122:26. The airplane’s descent and deceleration after 1121:50 indicated a reduction in total energy consistent with a loss of thrust.&#x0D;\nThe airplane’s Information Manual described that the airplane’s glide performance was 7.5 miles of range for every 5,000 ft of altitude lost for no flaps, no wind, propeller windmilling, and the airspeed maintained at between 90 – 100 mph (78 - 87 kts). During the descent that began at 1121:50, the airplane outperformed the reported glide performance while at an airspeed 10 kts faster than recommended and with a tailwind.&#x0D;\nAt the final ADS-B data point, the airplane was at an altitude of 5,475 ft and the ground elevation in the area was about 1,000 ft. At this point, the airplane’s reported glide range would have been 6.6 miles. At this altitude, the two closest airports – Marion Municipal Airport and Morrow County Airport – were both beyond the airplane’s glide performance. The airplane wreckage was located 4,800 ft from the final ADS-B return at an elevation of 951 ft msl and the wreckage indicated the airplane impacted nearly vertically on a heading of 90°. -",

The private pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was operated by a flight school who reported that the pilot was required to fly with a safety pilot. The pilot was scheduled to fly with a safety pilot the day before between 2000 and 0000, but he did not fly during those times. The pilot sent a text message to a representative of the operator at 0100 informing the person of the schedule change. Because of the time the text message was sent the operator did not reply. The operator also reported that the pilot did not have the required safety pilot during the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEarlier that morning according to Federal Aviation Administration automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B) data, the pilot flew from Miami Homestead General Aviation Airport (X51), Homestead, Florida, to Okeechobee County Airport (OBE), Okeechobee, Florida, and landed uneventfully about 0233.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that for the return flight to X51, he flew east of Lake Okeechobee then in a southerly direction to X51. According to the ADS-B data for the accident flight, after takeoff the flight climbed to 2,200 ft mean sea level (msl). The airplane remained at that altitude between 0336 and 0341, when the flight was about 49 nautical miles north-northwest of the destination airport. While continuing in a southerly direction over a non-populated area multiple heading and altitude changes occurred. The pilot stated that he flew into a “small cloud” while flying direct to X51, which caused him to become disoriented. When attempting to correct, he overcorrected and had trouble maintaining altitude. The flight continued then according to ADS-B data, at about 0354 while flying at 1,800 ft msl, the airplane made three 360° right descending turns with each successive turn radius becoming smaller. The airplane impacted into the Everglades coming to rest upright. The pilot was rescued about 7 hours later. Visual flight rules flight following was not requested during the accident flight. On the submitted National Transportation Safety Board Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident/Incident Report, the pilot reported no preimpact failures or malfunctions of the airplane or its systems.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was recovered for further examination.",

The pilot added that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions with the airplane. &#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with a squat switch on the left main landing gear that was designed to prevent the landing gear from inadvertently retracting; however, the switch required that sufficient weight be on the landing gear in order to work effectively. The pilot stated, and a video of the landing confirmed, that the airplane was still moving at relatively high speed when he selected the landing gear handle to the retracted position. The pilot reported that the squat switch was tested at the last annual inspection and that it operated normally during the inspection. Based on this information, it is likely that the airplane’s wings were still generating lift when the landing gear handle was selected to the retracted position and the gear struts was not compressed enough to activate the squat switch.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On October 27, 2023 about 1345 mountain daylight time, a Cessna T206H, N915DV, sustained substantial damage when it was involved in an accident near Huntington, Utah. The pilot sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nA family member stated that the pilot had traveled earlier in the morning from his base airport in Craig, Colorado to Vernal, Utah. After spending about two hours in Vernal, the pilot departed with a planned destination of Cedar City, Utah.  &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nInvestigators reviewed Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) provided Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data for the accident flight. The data disclosed that at about 1300 the airplane departed Vernal to the southwest and then proceeded west to Bottle Hollow Reservoir. Thereafter, at about 1310, the airplane headed on a southwest course and climbed to about 8,300 ft mean sea level (msl). At 1318, the airplane climbed to about 8,800 ft and remained at that altitude and on a constant southernly heading until the data ended at 1345. The last ADS-B data point was located adjacent to where the wreckage was located, near the peak of a hill (see Figure 1). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure 1: Airplane’s Flight Path&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators were unable to access the wreckage on site due to the steep terrain. The airplane was recovered and retained for a future examination.",

The pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, he arrived at North Perry Airport (HWO), Hollywood, Florida, at 1130 to begin preparing for a 1.5-hour long flight. He requested 20 gallons of fuel be added to each wing fuel tank (40 gallons total) and performed a preflight inspection of the airplane which included sampling both wing fuel tanks via their respective sump drains and both fuel lines via the fuel selector valve sump drain.&#x0D;\nAt 1300, the pilot started the engine with the fuel selector on the right fuel tank. He subsequently performed an engine run-up and departed without incident. After the leaving the traffic pattern at HWO, the pilot continued westbound to Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (TNT), Miami, Florida, where he performed a touch-and-go landing.&#x0D;\nThe pilot then flew back to HWO. He radioed the control tower when he was within 10 miles of the airport and performed his pre-landing checklist, when he began a descent for runway 10L. The pilot realized that he had been flying on the right fuel tank for about 1 hour and had never switched fuel tanks. He then switched to the left fuel tank to balance the fuel load.&#x0D;\nUpon touch down on runway 10L, the pilot retracted the wing flaps, visually checked the runway length remaining, and decided to perform a touch-and-go landing. He then applied full throttle, and confirmed he had a positive rate of climb.&#x0D;\nDuring the climb, at approximately 150 ft, the propeller rpm started to slow drastically, and then stopped turning completely. The pilot declared an emergency and confirmed that the landing gear was still down and locked. He observed a road in front of the airplane; however, there was traffic on the roadway. He then saw a grassy area next to a sidewalk which looked clear and braced for landing.&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage revealed that the airplane was substantially damaged, and no evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions of the airframe or engine. The examination further revealed the presence of water in the fuel system. This included water in the left and right fuel tanks, the fuel selector valve sump drain, the fuel servo, and the fuel distribution manifold.&#x0D;\nExamination of a sample of fuel from the fuel truck used by the fuel provider at HWO, did not show any evidence of water or contamination.",

The flight instructor described that the student’s wheel landing was at the proper speed and aligned with the runway, but with a slight left drift. The student applied right rudder along with (inadvertent) right brake pressure. The flight instructor announced “I have the aircraft” but felt significant resistance on the flight controls. He repeated the call as the airplane approached the right side of the runway. As the airplane progressed toward the grass off the side of the runway, the flight instructor again verbalized that he was trying to take control of the airplane as the student pilot applied both brakes. The airplane then abruptly stopped and nosed over. The airplane’s vertical stabilizer was substantially damaged during the accident. The flight instructor reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On October 24, 2023, about 15:20 central daylight time, a Raytheon Hawker 850XP, N269AA, was taking off on runway 22 when its left wing collided with the vertical stabilizer of a Textron Aviation (Cessna) Citation Mustang, N510HM, that was landing on runway 13R at William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), Houston, Texas. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\nThere were no injuries to the 2 pilots and 1 passenger aboard N269AA or to the 1 pilot and 3 passengers aboard N510HM. N269AA sustained minor damage and N510HM was substantially damaged during the collision. N269AA was operating as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 on-demand passenger flight from HOU to Waukesha County Airport (UES), Waukesha, Wisconsin. N510HM was operating as a Title 14 CFR Part 91 flight from Fulton County Executive Airport/Charlie Brown Field (FTY), Atlanta, Georgia, to HOU. &#x0D;\nHOU has intersecting runways, and the local controller had instructed the crew of N269AA to line up and wait (LUAW) on runway 22. The crew of N269AA said in a post-accident interview that they believed they heard that they were cleared for takeoff when they took off. The collision between the two airplanes occurred at the intersection of the two runways, see figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. View of both airplanes flight tracks with the area the ground collision occurred highlighted in yellow. The blue line represents N510HM, and the red line represents N269AA.&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA record of communications, at 1514:12 the crew of N269AA had contacted ground control (GC) requesting clearance to taxi for departure.&#x0D;\nAbout a minute later, the pilot of N510HM checked in with local control (LC) while on a nine-mile final to runway 13R. The local controller then cleared the pilot of N510HM to land. The pilot of N510HM read back the landing clearance.&#x0D;\nAs N269AA approached runway 22 for departure, about 1515:50, ground control instructed the crew of N269AA to monitor LC frequency. The flight crew stated in their post-accident interview that as they passed taxiway “K2” during their taxi to runway 22 they switched to the LC frequency. As the airplane began the left turn to be perpendicular to the runway, they stated the V-speeds were no longer on the display screens. &#x0D;\nAt 1517:32 the pilot of N510HM reported a four-mile final.&#x0D;\nAt 1518:01 the local controller instructed the crew of N269AA to LUAW on runway 22, to which the crew acknowledged. The local controller did not give a traffic advisory to N269AA. &#x0D;\nN269AA was in the takeoff roll on runway 22, when the flight data/clearance delivery controller alerted the local controller about N269AA’s movement, and at 1519:47 the local controller stated “november nine alpha alpha, stop, hold your position.” There was no response from the crew of N269AA, and at 1519:53 the local controller again stated, “alpha, alpha, hold your position, stop,” to which there was still no response. &#x0D;\nThe flight crew from N269AA stated in their post-accident interview they had a rudder bias alert, and a pitch trim alert which they had to resolve as they were in the takeoff roll.&#x0D;\nBoth crew members in N269AA said that they did not see the Citation Mustang until about 1 second prior to impact and described the feeling of the impact as a “thud.” The pilot in the left seat was the pilot flying (PF) and the pilot in the right seat was the pilot monitoring (PM).&#x0D;\nAt 1520:00, N269AA collided with N510HM. At 1520:14, the local controller began providing instructions to send around all aircraft that were on final approach behind N510HM.&#x0D;\nAt 1520:29 the crew of N269AA, who had taken off and was in the initial climb, informed local control that they needed to return to the airport, and the local controller provided vectors to return to the airport and land on runway 13R.&#x0D;\nAt 1521:08 The local controller cleared N269AA to land on runway 13R, and the flight landed otherwise uneventfully. &#x0D;\nIn the post-accident interview N510HM pilot said that he did not see N269AA airplane but heard a sound similar to a truck tire blowing out on a highway. N269AA crew stated that their airplane did not yaw, and they experienced no controllability issues during the takeoff. They were only aware of damage after parking and exiting the airplane.&#x0D;\nAirport Surface Detection Equipment:&#x0D;\nHOU tower is equipped with an Airport Surface Detection Equipment – Model X (ASDE-X) system, with displays located at the LC, GC, operations supervisor, and helicopter position workstations.&#x0D;\nASDE-X is a surface movement radar that enables air traffic controllers to detect potential runway conflicts by providing detailed coverage of movement on runways and taxiways. ASDE-X collects data from a variety of sources to track vehicles and aircraft on the airport movement area and obtain identification information from aircraft transponders.&#x0D;\nThe controllers noticed N269AA’s movement before the ASDE-X alert which occurred at 1519:49. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAircraft Damage Assessment: &#x0D;\nPost-accident examination of N269AA revealed that the left wing exhibited impact damage. The titanium leading-edge panel exhibited a “V-shape” aft indention to the wing front spar with sheet metal remnants of the Cessna Mustang embedded, see figure 2.&#x0D;\nN269AA’s left-wing winglet remained attached to the left wing. The winglet leading edge exhibited white paint transfer marks and the navigation light lens was impact separated and pieces of the glass were found in the Cessna Mustang’s tail cone/stinger. About ten inches of the top section of N269AA’s winglet had separated due to the impact with N510HM, see figure 3.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Close up view of N269AA’s left-wing leading-edge damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Close up view of N269AA’s left winglet/navigation light assembly damage.&#x0D;\nPost-crash examination of N510HM revealed that the left side of its tail section had been impacted by the left wing of N269AA. The torn skin on the tail section was consistent with N269AA’s wing penetrating the left side of N510HM’s tail stinger and exiting the right side, severing a portion of the stinger.  The impact damage was isolated to the area of the empennage, see figures 4, 5 and 6.  &#x0D;\nThe impact fractured and separated a section of the aft canted bulkhead. A section of the aft horizontal stabilizer spar; common to the rudder sector attach point, was torn and bent consistent with the wing impact. The rudder sector mount was torn from the structure at the fastener locations. &#x0D;\nThe rudder torque tube was fracture separated from the rudder control sector and the rudder.  The upper and lower left and lower right rudder control cables were broken in a manner consistent with tensile overload.  The upper right rudder control cable remained intact, but the ball end was pulled from the rudder sector.  The autopilot rudder servo control cable was fractured in tensile overload.  The left autopilot cable pulley bracket, with pully attached, was separated from the canted bulkhead. The left strake was impact fractured from the tail cone stinger and was recovered from the runway along with various sheet metal fragments from the stinger.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. Left side view of N510HM’s damage to its empennage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Aft view of N510HM’s damage to its empennage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6. Right side view of N510HM’s damage to its empennage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following NTSB specialists have been assigned to investigate the accident: operations, human performance, air traffic control, and cockpit voice recorder (CVR). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Air Traffic Controllers Union (NATCA), Textron Aviation, DuPage Aerospace Corporation (operator of N269AA), and My Jet DOM, LLC (operator of N510HM), are parties to the investigation.&#x0D;\nN269AA was equipped with a CVR, which was removed and sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for download and analysis. N510HM was not equipped with recorders.&#x0D;\nThe investigation is continuing.",

About 7 minutes into the flight and climbing through 12,000 ft mean sea level (msl), the engine sustained an abrupt loss of power that was confirmed by the loss of torque and engine compressor turbine rpm (Ng) speed. The pilot noted no cockpit warning or abnormal indications before the loss of engine power. The pilot declared an emergency and then executed a 180° turn back to the departure airport. &#x0D;\nThe pilot attempted two engine restarts, and both were unsuccessful. Unable to make it back to the airport, the pilot executed an off airport forced landing. During the forced landing, the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings. &#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the airframe, fuel system components, and functional engine test revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The fuel transfer pump switch was found in the manual position. The engine’s fuel was provided by the airframe header tank. Avionics data indicated that during the short flight, the header fuel tank quantity consistently decreased, and the airplane’s automatic fuel system did not continually resupply fuel to the header tank. &#x0D;\nBased on the available data, a functional engine test, and functional testing of the airplane’s fuel system, it is likely the pilot improperly configured the airplane’s fuel transfer system, which prevented the header fuel tank from automatically refilling during the flight and resulted in fuel starvation and total loss of engine power. Although the pilot reported that he had configured the airplane’s automatic fuel transfer system per the checklist, it is likely that the fuel transfer switch was in the manual or OFF position during the flight. In addition, the pilot did not properly monitor the header tank’s fuel quantity.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The following are excerpts and procedures from the JetProp DLX Pilot’s Operating Handbook and Federal Aviation Administration Approved Airplane Flight Manual:&#x0D;\nSection 3 Emergency Procedures&#x0D;\nEngine Power Loss in Flight – Engine Flame Out&#x0D;\nA flameout will be noticed by a drop in InterTurbine temperature (ITT), torquemeter pressure, and Ng. The engine may be restarted in the manner described under Air Starts.&#x0D;\nAir Start&#x0D;\nThe best air start technique is to initiate the re-light procedure immediately after a flameout occurs, provided the pilot is certain that the flameout was not the result of some malfunction which might make it dangerous to attempt a re-light.&#x0D;\nIf Ng drops below 50%, ignition switch off and proceed with normal air start procedures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Jet Prop DLX air start procedures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nManual Override Operation&#x0D;\nThe manual override switch should only be used to modulate engine power to allow the pilot to continue flight to the nearest airport should one of the following conditions occur:&#x0D;\n(a) Uncommanded engine power roll back to idle and unable to recover with the Power Control lever. &#x0D;\n(b) No response to the Power Control lever when starting from or around idle.&#x0D;\n(c) Power Control lever becomes stuck at or around idle. &#x0D;\nManually control fuel to the engine with short toggles of the switch. Forward increases fuel to the engine and aft reduces fuel to the engine.&#x0D;\nLoss of Fuel Flow&#x0D;\nIf a loss of fuel flow is experienced, turn the other fuel boost pump on and ensure the firewall fuel shutoff is on/open. If fuel flow does not return to normal, turn the transfer pump to manual or the emergency transfer pump on to help provide pressure to the engine.  &#x0D;\nSection 7 Description and Operation&#x0D;\nFuel System&#x0D;\nThe JetProp uses the standard PA-46-350P aircraft fuel system with the addition of outboard wing fuel filler caps, enabling the wing tanks to each be filled with 10 additional gallons of fuel, and a header tank which accumulates fuel from the selected wing tank. The header tank prevents the possibility of interruption of fuel supply to the engine during the selection of an alternate wing tank. The total usable fuel was 140 gallons in the wing tanks and 11.1 gallons in the header tank. The unusable fuel quantity is 1 gallon in each wing tank and 1.1 gallons in the header tank. &#x0D;\nA fuel transfer pump is located in each wing collector sump tank, and the pumps provide fuel from the wing tanks to the header tank. The operation of these pumps is controlled by the fuel selector handle and the transfer pump rocker switch. The position of the fuel selector handle determines which wing tank and respective pump will be used. Automatic or manual operation of the pumps is determined by the transfer pump switch (AUTO/OFF/MAN). In the OFF position, neither tank supplies fuel to the header tank, and neither transfer pump is powered. In AUTO mode, the selected pump is automatically turned on and off to keep the header tank filled. In MAN mode, the selected pump runs continuously. If a wing transfer pump fails, the emergency fuel transfer pump can be used to transfer fuel from either of the wing tanks to the header tank to ensure no fuel is trapped in a wing tank.&#x0D;\nHeader Tank&#x0D;\nAll fuel to the engine is supplied from the header tank. Header tank fuel quantity is sensed by a float/capacitance probe and is indicated by a separate cockpit gauge. Float switches independent of the quantity indicator sensor provide inputs for the fuel level controller and the header tank fuel low (HT FUEL LOW) warning light. When the header tank fuel level decreases to approximately 10.5 gallons, the automatic fuel controller is designed to activate the fuel transfer pump and HT FUEL LOW caution light. The caution light is a reminder to the pilot that some action by the automatic system or manually by the pilot to ensure the header tank is refilled. The header tank has two submerged internal fuel boost pumps. The boost pumps are pilot-selectable by a three-position (PUMP 1, OFF, PUMP 2) rocker switch on the instrument panel. These pumps are located in the sump-shaped bottom of the header tank and provide positive fuel pressure to the engine driven fuel pump.&#x0D;\nFuel System Management&#x0D;\nThe fuel system was designed to require very little pilot action under normal operating conditions. Fuel system management under normal operating conditions consists of monitoring fuel flow and pressure, monitoring header tank fuel level to ensure a full level and controlling wing fuel balance. The header tank must be kept full by either automatic or manual means. Under most cruise and descent conditions, wing fuel is drawn into the header tank by the suction created by the outflow of fuel to the engine. At higher fuel flow rates during periods of high-power operations or steep climb attitudes, the fuel flow out of the header tank will be greater than that being drawn into the tank.&#x0D;\nIn automatic mode, as selected by the AUTO position on the cockpit fuel transfer switch, the automatic fuel control system utilizes two float switches, one to sense when the fuel level is low and one to signal when the tank is full. The low float switch, internal to the header tank, signals the header tank fuel level controller when the header tank fuel level is about 10.5 gallons. With the fuel transfer pump switch in the AUTO position, the battery or generator/alternator providing power to the main bus, and the fuel selector in the LEFT/RIGHT position, the controller then activates the selected wing tank transfer pump. Any time one of the wing fuel transfer pumps is powered, the “WING FUEL PUMP” annunciator light illuminates. The “HT FUEL LOW” caution light will normally flash on for a few seconds and then extinguish as fuel is pumped into the header tank. The wing transfer pump continues to operate until the header tank is full, activating the upper float switch which signals the controller to shut off the wing transfer pump in the selected wing tank. The cycle is automatically repeated to maintain fuel in the header tank.&#x0D;\nIf the pilot desires to maintain the fuel level in the header tank manually, the MAN fuel transfer pump position will be used. In the MAN position, the pump in the selected wing tank will run continuously. Normally the pilot would wait until the “HT FUEL LOW” caution light illuminated, or the header tank fuel quantity indicated 10.5 gallons, and then turn the fuel transfer pump to the MAN position. When the header tank is full (gauge indication and/or header tank high pressure light), the transfer pump would then be placed in the OFF position. This process would be repeated as necessary to maintain the desired fuel quantity in the header tank. - A review of the airplane’s maintenance records revealed that in 2003 the airplane was modified to a JetProp DLX per a supplemental type certificate, which included the installation of a Pratt and Whitney Canda (PWC) PT6A-35 turboprop engine.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he purchased the airplane in 2014.&#x0D;\nOn August 22, 2023, an airframe logbook entry indicated that a Garmin G500TXi system and other avionics were installed, and an Aspen Avionics primary and multifunction flight display system was removed. According to the pilot, due to delays in available avionics components, the airplane was out of service in maintenance for about 1 year and 4 months. According to the airplane HOBBS indicator, at the time of the accident, the airplane had accumulated about 11 hours of total time since the avionics installation. - On October 23, 2023, at 1611 central daylight time, a Piper PA-46-350P airplane, N92884, sustained substantial damage when it was involved in an accident near Pierre, South Dakota. The pilot sustained serious injuries, and the passenger sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, before takeoff from the Pierre Regional Airport (PIR), Pierre, South Dakota, the airplane was fueled with 10 gallons of fuel for a total of 100 gallons on board for the planned flight to Steamboat Springs, Colorado. The pilot reported that before takeoff, the header fuel tank contained 11 gallons of fuel, fuel boost pump No. 1 was selected, the fuel transfer switch was in the AUTO position, and the fuel selector was in the right fuel tank position. No anomalies were noted during the engine start, takeoff, and initial climb.&#x0D;\nAbout 11,000 ft mean sea level (msl), air traffic control cleared the pilot to flight level 220. While climbing through 12,000 ft msl, the engine sustained an abrupt loss of power that was confirmed by the loss of torque and engine compressor turbine rpm (Ng) speed. The pilot noted no cockpit warning or abnormal indications before the loss of engine power. The pilot declared an emergency and then executed a 180° turn back to PIR (see Figure 1).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Overhead view of the flight track.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the emergency descent, the pilot attempted to restart the engine by switching boost pumps, switching the fuel tank selector, and activating the emergency header tank pump, but the restart was unsuccessful. The pilot declared an emergency and intended to return to PIR. The pilot attempted another engine restart procedure with the fuel at cutoff, boost pump on, igniters at AUTO, generator off, and starter on. At this time, Ng was about 15%, the fuel condition lever was advanced, and a “pop” was heard with a puff of smoke from the right exhaust. The engine torque did not increase, so the pilot closed the fuel condition lever. The pilot reported he did not use the manual override fuel switch during the emergency descent.&#x0D;\nThe pilot also reported that while maneuvering back toward PIR, the airplane also lost electrical power, which resulted in a loss of the primary flight display, both GPS displays, and annunciator panel. The condition resulted in the pilot becoming disorientated in the descent to the airport. He realized he was going to be unable to make PIR and attempted a forced landing to bluffs and rolling terrain (see Figure 2).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Airplane as it came to rest in the rolling terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted the terrain, came to rest upright, and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and both wings.&#x0D;\nAfter the accident, the pilot observed that the passenger, who was seated in a rear forward-facing seat, was barely conscious. After checking the passenger’s vital signs, the pilot performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until first responders arrived on scene. &#x0D;\nInitial postaccident examination of the airplane at the accident site revealed no preimpact external anomalies or malfunctions, and the airplane was retained for further examination. - An autopsy was not performed on the passenger. - Examination of the airframe revealed the cockpit battery display indicated 24.7 volts, the fuel selector was in the right tank position, the fuel transfer pump switch was in the manual position, and the emergency fuel transfer switch was off. The header tank contained about 2.4 gallons of fuel consistent with Jet A. &#x0D;\nThe fuel line between the oil/fuel heater and the engine fuel pump was opened and no fuel drained from the fuel line. The airframe fuel filter and bowl contained about 1 pint of fuel that was clear of contaminants. The airframe fuel system, to include the right-wing fuel transfer pump, fuel selector valve, emergency transfer fuel pump, header tank Nos. 1 and 2 boost pumps, header tank float switch, header tank pressure transducer, firewall shutoff valve, and annunciator panel lights were tested, and no anomalies were noted. The fuel lines, from the wings to the engine fuel pump, were clear of obstructions when blown with compressed air. &#x0D;\nThe left-wing fuel transfer pump wiring was damaged during the recovery process, and the pump was removed for further examination. The transfer pump was bench tested at Piper Aircraft, Inc, Vero Beach, Florida, and no anomalies were noted.&#x0D;\nAll four propeller blades were bent aft and found secure in the propeller hub. The blades were in the low pitch position and displayed minor cambered face scratching.&#x0D;\nFollowing an airframe examination, the engine was removed from the airframe and shipped to PWC for a functional test. The engine was installed in the test cell and serviced with oil. The engine was functionally tested, which included a dry motoring check, engine start, engine warm up at ground idle setting, normal acceleration, normal deceleration, and shut down. A second engine start was done to perform engine handling tests, slam acceleration, and slam deceleration checks. According to PWC, during both engine functional test runs, the engine performance and behavior was within specifications with no limits exceeded.&#x0D;\nThe Garmin G500 TXi system primary flight display was removed and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board’s Recorders Laboratory for data extraction. According to the data, about 7 minutes after takeoff, the engine sustained a loss of fuel flow, engine torque, and Ng, consistent with the reported loss of engine power. Before takeoff, the header fuel tank quantity indicated 10.8 gallons, and during the flight, the header tank fuel quantity continually decreased to 5.7 gallons until the engine power loss. About 1 minute after the power loss, the header fuel tank quantity began to increase, and about 4 minutes later, the header tank fuel quantity reached 11.1 gallons and remained at that quantity until the accident impact. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On October 22, 2023, about 1515 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-24-250 airplane, N6757P, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Ottawa, Ohio. The private pilot incurred minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he was preparing for the flight from Abrams Municipal Airport (4D0), Grand Ledge, Michigan to Pompano Beach Airpark (PMP), Pompano Beach, Florida, after purchasing the airplane. He conducted a full walk-around inspection and found no issues with the airplane. He departed from runway 27 with full fuel tanks (about 60 gallons). &#x0D;\nAbout 5 minutes after takeoff, he observed a few sporadic clouds overhead, so he applied carburetor heat for about 30 seconds, and the airplane “buffered a lot.” About 40 minutes into the flight, at 6,700 ft msl, he noticed a 5-inch drop in manifold pressure. He immediately applied carburetor heat for about 90 seconds. He stated that the airplane “buffered really hard.” &#x0D;\nBetween 1450 and 1506, he applied carburetor heat no less than 4 times for about 30 seconds each time while continuing to monitor the other engine indications. About 1507, with the carburetor heat still on, he heard a bang and the airplane shuddered. There was no response from the propeller or the engine. The engine lost all power and he began looking for a road to land the airplane on. He discussed his intentions with air traffic control. Unable to find a road without powerlines or automobile traffic, he landed the airplane in a flat field. After touchdown, the airplane entered a cornfield and came to rest upright. He exited the airplane on his own and was met by first responders.&#x0D;\nAn inspector with the Federal Aviation Administration responded to the accident site and examined the wreckage. The wreckage was found upright in the cornfield. There was no fire. The fuselage and wings were substantially damaged.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to an aircraft storage facility where an examination was performed by the NTSB investigator-in-charge. The engine remained attached to the engine mount that was attached to the firewall. External examination of the engine did not reveal any evidence of case rupture or oil leakage. Control continuity was established from the cockpit controls to the carburetor and propeller. The fuel system gascolators were drained; one contained about 2 ounces of blue-colored fuel and the other contained about 1 ounce of blue-colored fuel. Both samples contained a trace amount of gray particulates that resembled sand.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe top spark plugs were removed; the electrodes exhibited normal wear and light gray, lean coloring as compared to a Champion Check-A-Plug inspection chart. Internal engine continuity was confirmed by manually turning the propeller. Compression and suction were observed on all cylinders when the propeller was rotated. Valve action was correct. Both magnetos produced spark to all leads when rotated manually. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor was removed and partially disassembled. The bowl was dry and clean. The brass floats were undamaged. The inlet fuel screen was unobstructed and contained a trace amount of light gray particulates that resembled sand. The accelerator pump operated normally. The engine-driven fuel pump was unremarkable.&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine and fuel system did not reveal an anomaly or malfunction that would have prevented normal operation.&#x0D;\nFAA Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (CE-09-35) – Carburetor Icing Prevention, stated that: &#x0D;\n“…pilots should be aware that carburetor icing doesn't just occur in freezing conditions, it can occur at temperatures well above freezing temperatures when there is visible moisture or high humidity. Icing can occur in the carburetor at temperatures above freezing because vaporization of fuel, combined with the expansion of air as it flows through the carburetor, (Venturi Effect) causes sudden cooling, sometimes by a significant amount within a fraction of a second. Carburetor ice can be detected by a drop in rpm in fixed pitch propeller airplanes and a drop in manifold pressure in constant speed propeller airplanes. In both types, usually there will be a roughness in engine operation.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the CE-09-35 carburetor icing probability chart revealed the airplane was operated in conditions conducive to icing at glide and cruise power and serious icing at glide power. -",

During the takeoff roll, the airplane began pulling and turning to the left, and despite the pilot’s control applications, the airplane departed the runway and its left wing collided with the runway’s precision approach path indicator (PAPI) lights. The collision with the PAPI lights resulted in substantial damage to the left wing. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane.",

    "FactualNarrative": "On October 21, 2023, at approximately 1340 EDT, a Cessna 172L, N7716G, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Richmond, Virginia. The flight instructor, student pilot, and one passenger were not injured. The airplane was operating as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor reported that the purpose of the flight was to conduct a review of flight maneuvers in a designated practice area. On the return flight to OFP, the engine began to lose power. The power loss progressed until the airplane could no longer maintain level flight. The flight instructor initiated an emergency landing in an open field short of the runway. During the landing rollout the right wing struck a tree, resulting in substantial damage.&#x0D;\nA Federal Aviation Administration inspector conducted an on-site examination and noted that the right wing exhibited damage consistent with impact with a small tree located at the accident site. The cabin section showed damage at the right-wing root attachment area. The left wing displayed upward bending from the wingtip about 2 feet inboard.&#x0D;\nAn engine examination established valvetrain continuity with crankshaft rotation through 720°. Ignition continuity was confirmed during the examination of the magnetos, ignition wires, and spark plugs. An undetermined amount of fuel sufficient for flight was found in both fuel tanks.&#x0D;\nThe carburetor was partially disassembled. It was observed that the float bracket had fractured into two pieces. The float remained attached to the bracket by the float lever shaft, and the float valve was coupled to the float by a clip mounted on the float lever shaft. The float’s movement along the shaft allowed axial motion of the float valve within the float valve seat, restricting fuel flow into the bowl when the valve sealed against the seat.&#x0D;\nThe carburetor components were submitted to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Materials Laboratory for further examination. Analysis revealed that one arm of the float bracket had fractured due to cyclic fatigue. The fracture surface was flat with radiating lines and curved crack growth features consistent with fatigue failure. The origin of the fracture was along the interior edge where the bracket arm intersected the base of the bracket. No anomalies were observed at the fracture origin. &#x0D;\nA review of the logbook excerpts revealed that in 2005 there was an IRAN (Inspect &amp; Repair As Necessary) performed that referred to the replacement of the various original accessories including the carburetor. No other maintenance was noted on carburetor since 2005. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and passenger departed from their home in Utah to a coastal airport in Northern California. After a 4 hour and 11-minute flight, the airplane arrived at the intended destination, but did not descend and subsequently turned inland, possibly due to the presence of cloud cover at the destination. The airplane landed and the pilot obtained about 90 gallons of fuel at an airport about 40 nautical miles southeast of the intended destination. The accident occurred during the subsequent departure from runway 28. A witness reported that the airplane lifted off near the end of the 3,670-ft-long runway, clearing trees by about 20 ft before it began a left turn that progressed into a steep turn with an estimated 70-80° bank angle. The witness then noted that, “as it was banking, it started coming lower,” and that when the airplane started to bank, “it lost a lot of altitude from that [the start of the bank] to when it hit the mountain.” &#x0D;\nThe wreckage was mostly consumed by postcrash fire. Although another witness reported hearing a “popping” sound from the airplane, postaccident examination of the airplane and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Performance calculations indicated that the airplane would have required a takeoff ground roll distance of about 2,600 ft based on its loading and the atmospheric conditions about the time of the accident. It could not be determined whether the pilot initiated the takeoff from the beginning of the runway and used substantially more runway than that predicted by performance calculations, or if the pilot may have initiated the takeoff from the taxiway intersection nearest the self-service fuel pumps, from which point about 2,400 ft of runway was available. &#x0D;\nThe airport was surrounded by mountainous terrain. The Federal Aviation Administration chart supplement insufficiently described the topography off the departure end of runway 28, as it failed to include any description of the peaks and valleys immediately off the end of the runway nor did it include the presence of a 4,000 foot-tall mountain peak about 1 nm west of the runway end. A witness stated that most airplanes departing the accident airport used runway 10. The terrain off the departure end of runway 10 comprised mostly open farm fields for several miles. &#x0D;\nThe reason for the pilot’s steep turn just after takeoff could not be determined based on the available information. It is possible that he may have been maneuvering due to the rising terrain or attempting to return to the runway due to a perceived problem (the “pop” sound noted by a witness). The angle of descent indicated by impact signatures at the accident site was more consistent with a controlled flight into terrain event than that of an aerodynamic stall and loss of control; therefore, it is likely that the pilot failed to maintain clearance from trees while maneuvering after takeoff. A departure from runway 10 instead of runway 28 would have provided the pilot with more favorable terrain clearance and forced landing sites if the pilot had encountered an anomaly during the takeoff.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The airplane weight and balance was calculated using an empty weight of 2,599 lbs, a fuel weight of 684 lbs, pilot and passenger weights of 227 lbs and 160 lbs respectively, and a baggage weight of 100 lbs. According to the calculation, the airplane’s gross weight at the time of the accident was about 3,770. The airplane was equipped with wingtip fuel tanks, which had been installed under supplemental type certificate SA4-1629. According to the STC, the maximum takeoff weight for the accident airplane was 3,833 lbs. &#x0D;\nPerformance&#x0D;\nThe airplane’s ground roll was computed using the flaps-up takeoff distance chart from the pilot operating handbook (POH) and temperature of 26°C, a tailwind of 1 kt, and an obstacle of 50 ft. The chart also accounted for the following conditions: takeoff power, mixture full rich, landing gear retracted after positive climb established, cowl flaps open, and a paved, level, dry runway surface. According to the chart, the takeoff speed over a 50 ft obstacle was about 84 kts. The computations indicated that the airplane would have required a ground roll of at least 2,500 ft. According to STC SA4-1629, the takeoff distance is increased by 5% for every 100 lbs above 3,650 lbs for takeoffs at all heights above 50 ft. This would have extended the takeoff roll to 2,625 ft. &#x0D;\nThe climb chart in the POH showed a climb rate of about 1,190 fpm based on a pressure altitude near sea level, a temperature of 26°C, and a weight of 3,600 lbs (the maximum provided in the chart). According to STC SA4-1629, at weights above 3,650 lbs, the climb rate should be reduced by 100 fpm when the total weight is 3,780 lbs and the airplane is operating at sea level. &#x0D;\nStall Speeds&#x0D;\nThe POH included a chart to compute the airplane’s stall speeds at idle power. At the chart’s maximum weight envelope of 3,650 lbs and a maximum bank angle of 60°, the airplane’s stall speed would have been 84 kts. &#x0D;\nAccording to the POH, the stall speed at idle power with flaps retracted at 0° of bank was about 69 kts indicated airspeed (KIAS). Based on the stall information in STC SA4-1629, at 0° of bank, the stall speed with flaps retracted at 3,700 lbs would have been 63 KIAS. At 3,833 lbs, the stall speed would have been 64.5 KIAS.&#x0D;\nAn analysis of the airplane’s turning performance was completed using Figure 2.29 contained in the publication Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators (NAVWEPS 00-80T-80), based on a witness statement regarding where the turn began and the location of the wreckage. According to the chart, the bank angle required to maintain a turn radius of about 600 ft at an estimated true airspeed (TAS) of about 90 kts (84 kts KIAS) was about 51° given a constant altitude. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3: Start of turn and estimated distance - According to the Federal Aviation Administration chart supplement, runway 28 at O09 was 3,670 ft long and had a 270-ft-long displaced threshold. There were trees in the vicinity of the runway. &#x0D;\nThe airport was surrounded by peaks and valleys mountainous terrain. A review of the surrounding terrain showed there was 200 to 400- ft of rising peaks between valleys immediately off the departure end of runway 28. In addition, there was an approximately 4,000- ft- tall mountain peak about 1 nm west of the runway 28 departure end. A resident who lived near the departure end of runway 28 reported that airplanes normally departed the other direction (using runway 10).&#x0D;\nA taxiway and self-service fuel pump was located near the approach end to runway 28. (See Figure 1.) The distance from the taxiway intersection to the departure end of runway 28 was about 2,400 ft. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Airport fuel island and runway entrance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airport was surrounded by mountainous terrain. (See Figure 2.) A review of the surrounding terrain showed 200 to 400-ft peaks between valleys immediately off the departure end of runway 28. In addition, there was an approximate 4,000-ft-tall mountain peak about 1 nm west of the runway 28 departure end. A resident who lived near the departure end of runway 28 reported that airplanes normally departed the other direction (using runway 10). The topography off the departure end of runway 10 was mostly flat and at the same field elevation as O09 for 2-4 nm depending on the direction of flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: Flight path, accident site, and surrounding terrain&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration chart did not describe the topography off the departure end of runway 28 including the peaks and valleys immediately off the end of the runway or the presence of a 4,000 foot-tall mountain peak about 1 nm west of the runway end. - On October 20, 2023, about 1801 Pacific daylight time, a Beechcraft A36, N8248K, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Covelo, California. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAutomatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B) data retrieved from a web-based source showed that the airplane departed Heber City, Utah, about 1235 and flew to Shelter Cove Airport (0Q5), Shelter Cove, California. The airplane reached the town of Shelter Cove at 1646, but maintained an altitude of about 3,500 ft mean sea level and completed a 180° left turn to the northeast while over the airport. At 1650:35, the airplane turned to the east and continued about 7.5 nautical miles (nm). The ADS-B flight track data ceased at 1654:29 about 1 nm east of Garberville Airport (O16), Garberville, California. A fuel receipt indicated that the pilot purchased about 90 gallons of fuel at Round Valley Airport (O09), Covelo, California (about 31 nm southeast of O16), on the day of the accident; the fuel receipt was not timestamped.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was departing O09 when the accident occurred. According to a witness, the airplane lifted off the runway surface near the departure end of runway 28 at O09. As the airplane passed near the witness’ house, his kids waved to the pilot, who then waved back. The airplane then began a left turn in a nose-high attitude before it disappeared from the witness’ view. About this time, a second witness observed the airplane as it cleared a group of trees by about 20 ft while it continued its left turn about 60 ft above ground level. As the airplane turned towards the east, its bank angle increased to about 70-80° and the airplane subsequently descended into the ground. The witness noted that, “as it was banking, it started coming lower,” and that when the airplane started to bank, “it lost a lot of altitude from that [the start of the bank] to when it hit the mountain.” The airplane exploded after it impacted the ground and a postcrash fire ensued.&#x0D;\nThe first witness reported that the engine sounded normal and then he heard a “popping” sound. The second witness stated that the engine sounded normal. - An autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Mendocino County Sheriff-Coroner. The autopsy report was reviewed by the NTSB Investigator-In-Charge. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was blunt force trauma of the head and trunk. - Weather satellite imagery indicated cloud cover along the coast at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness, the skies at the accident airport were clear with little to no wind at the time of the accident. The calculated density altitude based on temperature, weather and barometric pressure from the closest airport weather station about 39 nm southwest of O09 was 3,220.6 ft. &#x0D;\nThe pilot obtained a weather briefing about 1219 through ForeFlight before departure from Utah. O09 was not listed in any of the flight planning categories. - The airplane came to rest oriented on a northeasterly heading on a hillside about 0.4 nm west of the departure end of runway 28, at an elevation about 1,500 ft msl. The airplane’s major structures were all accounted for at the accident site. The first point of impact (FPI) was marked by several trees about 20 ft tall with broken treetops and broken branches at the base of each tree. A 50-ft-long debris path was traced from the FPI to the main wreckage, which was mostly consumed by postcrash fire.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "United Airlines (UAL) flight 3885, a Boeing 787, impacted a hangar with its right-wing tip while taxiing to parking at Chicago O’Hare International Airport (KORD), Chicago, Illinois. The flight was a maintenance ferry flight conducted under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 from Newark Liberty International Airport (KEWR), Newark, New Jersey. &#x0D;\nAccording to the flight crew, after landing on runway 10C at ORD they were cleared to taxi to a UAL maintenance facility via taxiways P to Z. After receiving an air traffic control (ATC) clearance, they crossed runway 10L, continued via taxiway Z crossing both runways 9R and 9C before making a right turn onto taxiway D. Ground control cleared them to enter the ramp at taxiway YY1 and to contact UAL’s Maintenance Ramp frequency. UAL maintenance subsequently instructed them to make a left on YY, which was incorrect, and proceed to the north side of the ramp, where a truck with marshallers would be waiting to guide them to parking. After completing the left turn on YY, the flight crew realized they were about to enter an American Eagle ramp area instead of their intended destination of the UAL ramp area.&#x0D;\nUnfamiliar with the area they stopped the airplane and queried UAL maintenance as to where they should park. UAL maintenance asked the flight crew to proceed onto the American Eagle ramp and make a 180° turn. The captain noted no wingspan restrictions on the airport charts and no obstacles other than hangars in the area.  He stated that there were no taxiway lights; however, there was adequate overhead lighting on the ramp. &#x0D;\nThe captain then asked the first officer (FO) if they were clear to the right, to which the FO responded “yes”. Shortly thereafter, while proceeding onto the ramp and on the associated taxiway line they heard a loud bang and the airplane veered to the right. The FO looked out his window and stated, “we hit the hangar”.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUAL Maintenance Ramp Area&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - Google Earth image with taxi route in red. The inset photo of accident site was provided by United Airlines. Green arrow indicates the location of United Airlines maintenance ramp area.  &#x0D;\nThe right-wing tip of the airplane struck a hanger resulting in minor damage to the wing. The damage to the hanger was estimated at about $236,000.  A B787 has a wingspan of 197 feet 3 inches. The distance from the taxiway centerline to the hangar was about 98 ft accommodating a wingspan of about 196 ft.  &#x0D;\nHad the marshallers met the airplane at American Eagle ramp and provided obstruction clearance guidance and/or the flight crew requested additional ground handling support before attempting to turn around in an unfamiliar area it is likely that the collision would not have occurred.",

The pilot was not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that during landing gear retraction after takeoff, he heard a “pop” that emanated from the rear cockpit area, and the landing gear retraction handle did not return to the center position as expected. He attempted to extend the landing gear, but it would not extend. He attempted the emergency extension procedures which allowed the landing gear doors to open, and the landing gear came out of their respective landing gear wells. Only the nose landing gear locked into the down position and the main landing gear remained partially extended. &#x0D;\nThe pilot contacted the PUB controller and elected to remain airborne for several hours to burn off some of the fuel supply. Multiple additional attempts to lower the landing gear were unsuccessful and the pilot eventually executed a landing to runway 8R at PUB. During the landing, the nose landing gear remained in the down position and the main landing gear were in a partially extended position. The airplane skidded to a stop and incurred substantial damage to the left horizontal stabilizer and elevator.",

The flight crew reported that shortly after takeoff they heard a loud bang from the left side of the airplane and received an EICAS (engine indicating and crew alerting system) message and left engine fire warning. The flight crew pulled the No. 1 engine fire handle, discharged both fire suppression bottles, and performed an in-flight turnback. The fire indication eventually ceased as the airplane was returning to MEM and made an uneventful single engine landing. No injuries were reported. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 cargo flight from MEM to Harry Reid International Airport (LAS), Las Vegas, Nevada.&#x0D;\nUpon landing, airport rescue and fire fighting (ARFF) observed damage to the No. 1 engine thrust reverser and core cowling, but no indications of an active fire. No fire suppressant was applied to the engine. Ground inspection of the No. 1 engine with the cowls and thrust reverser opened revealed the engine had experienced an undercowl fire and the main fuel pump (MFP) housing had fractured from the main fuel supply line. The MFP exhibited thermal distress and melting of the fracture surface. &#x0D;\nParties to the investigation include the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing, FedEx, Collins Aerospace, Airline Pilots Association, and General Electric who convened at the FedEx maintenance hangar in Memphis, TN on November 14, 2023 to document the No. 1 engine, thrust reverser, and cowling damage. The MFP was removed and sent to the Collins Aerospace facility in Rockford, IL for additional examination.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot performed a visual approach to the runway in calm wind conditions with the flaps extended halfway (approach flaps). Flight track information indicated that the airplane was fast crossing the runway displaced threshold, and touched down with about 4,000 ft of runway remaining at a speed about 135 knots (kts), which was 19 kts above the highest published approach speed for the airplane’s gross weight at the time of landing. The pilot reported that, after touchdown, he moved the power levers into the ground fine position to help slow the airplane, but he did not feel the “normal deceleration.” He applied the brakes and then “stood on the brakes,” adding that he did not feel the tires sliding, then applied maximum reverse thrust in an attempt to bring the airplane to a stop on the runway. The airplane rolled past the departure end of the runway, onto a displaced threshold, and then into the engineered material arresting system past the departure end of the runway. During the runway excursion, the nose landing gear wheel assembly separated and the right engine was displaced from its normal position. Postaccident examination revealed that one tire on each main landing gear exhibited flat-spotting through the tread, consistent with a sliding tire. &#x0D;\nAlthough the pilot commanded the propeller blade angle to move less than the flight idle low pitch stop setting during the landing roll, the propeller blades could not move to this position until the airplane slowed to about 100 kts or less, which did not occur until the airplane was more than 3,400 ft down the 5,000-ft-long runway. At speeds above 100 kts, the propeller was governed by the constant speed unit, which will not allow the pilot to command ground fine or reverse thrust settings. Thus, there were no systems failures or malfunctions that prevented movement of the propeller blades to ground fine or reverse. &#x0D;\nThe application of full reverse thrust when the airplane was likely greater than 100 kts indicated airspeed likely further increased the required stopping distance by adding engine power and thrust in the forward direction. The added forward thrust, combined with the flat-spotting of several tires during the landing roll, likely cumulatively increased the required landing roll distance, resulting in insufficient runway remaining to avoid a runway overrun.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The airplane was equipped with avionics that could record and retain flight and engine data; however, a secure digital (SD) card was not in the appropriate slot of any of the avionics. Therefore, flight and engine data were not available for the accident flight.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was also equipped with five-blade, constant speed, full feathering and reversing propellers. The Flight Manual Supplement associated with the propeller installation specified that there was no change to the constant speed propeller governor or constant speed unit (CSU), and the performance was equal to or better than the baseline airplane. According to the propeller manufacturer, with the propeller levers full forward, the propeller would still be controlled by the governor to about 100 kts indicated airspeed (KIAS).&#x0D;\nAccording to the airplane Pilot’s Operating Handbook and Federal Aviation Administration Approved Airplane Flight Manual (POH/AFM), as part of the normal landing checklist, the propeller levers were to be placed full forward. After touchdown, the power levers were to be lifted and moved aft into the ground fine position, which would provide optimum deceleration by taking advantage of the maximum available propeller drag. The systems description of the POH/AFM indicated that at touchdown, with activation of the low pitch stop solenoid by the right squat switch, propeller blade angle can only move from the flight idle low pitch stop setting to the ground idle low pitch stop setting when the propeller is no longer controlled by the governor or CSU and when there is movement of the power lever from Flight Idle to Ground Fine.&#x0D;\nThe pilot indicated that the airplane’s landing weight was 10,836 lbs. The POH/AFM published Vref speeds at 11,000 pounds for a 3° approach with flaps down and up were 93 kts and 116 kts, respectively. There was no landing distance chart for the approach flaps setting.&#x0D;\nA review of over 90 days of an electronic flight log, which included the accident flight, revealed no comments regarding propeller blade angle below flight idle. Excluding the accident flight, the accident pilot was listed as flight crew on 28 of the 29 flights. He later stated that he had not experienced any landing sequence anomaly associated with the ground fine propeller setting during any of the previous landings. - Runway 21L was about 6,000 ft long and equipped with a displaced threshold, making about 5,000 ft of landing distance available. EMAS was installed past the departure end of the runway. - On October 18, 2023, about 1511 eastern daylight time, a Beech 300, N93GA, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Atlanta, Georgia. The airline transport pilot and one passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 business flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that, during the approach for landing, the airplane’s speed was 162 knots (kts) at 500 ft above ground level, which was above the speed for full flap extension. The pilot then chose to perform a normal half-flaps landing. He later reported that he was following a jet on final approach and was flying a slightly high approach path with partial flaps, anticipating a potential go-around. He stated that the airplane touched down “slightly long,” but he felt he had plenty of runway on which to stop. &#x0D;\nReview of flight track information revealed that the airplane crossed the runway displaced threshold at a calibrated airspeed of 150 knots (kts), which was 30 kts faster than the conservative no-flaps landing approach speed reported by the pilot (120 kts) and 34 kts faster than the published no-flap approach speed for the airplane’s weight. The airplane touched down about 1,000 ft past the displaced threshold at 135 kts calibrated airspeed.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that, after touchdown, he moved each power lever to the ground fine position, but he did not hear the normal propeller pitch sound change nor detect deceleration. He applied the brakes, then “stood on the toe brakes” and applied maximum reverse. He later stated that it was not normal to select reverse when landing in the accident airplane. Review of flight track and aircraft performance data indicated that the airplane did not slow to 100 kts calibrated airspeed until slightly more than 3,400 ft down the runway, with only about 1,600 ft of runway remaining. The pilot was unable to stop the airplane before rolling past the departure end of the runway onto the displaced threshold and then into an engineered material arresting system (EMAS) at a groundspeed about 40 kts. The airplane came to rest in the EMAS in a nose-low attitude. - Aviation surface observation reports taken about 18 minutes before the accident and 42 minutes after the accident reported in part, calm wind, and a variable wind at 5 knots, respectively. A one-minute wind report taken at the time of the accident reported wind from 330° magnetic at 1 knot. - Postaccident examination of the airplane, which was not equipped with a brake antiskid system, revealed that all main landing gear tires were deflated, and the outer tire on each main landing gear exhibited flat-spotting through the tread. The nose landing gear wheel and tire assembly with fork and axle assembly and attached lower knee was separated from the nose landing gear and found in proximity to the main wreckage. The right engine assembly was displaced down with structural damage behind/at the firewall noted. -",

The pilot noted the windsock nearest the airplane indicated a tailwind, but the other windsocks farther down the runway indicated a headwind or crosswind. During takeoff, the airplane became airborne faster than expected and climbed well, so the pilot made an early right turn over airport hangars. The airplane’s upper wing slats fluttered which indicated to the pilot that the airspeed was low, then they “came out hard,” which indicated the airplane was near a stall. The pilot ensured the throttle was full forward and decreased pitch attitude to maintain airspeed but felt like the airplane “was being forced down.” Unable to maintain altitude, and with no suitable forced landing area, he maneuvered the airplane to collide with the side of a hangar and the ground, then it nosed over. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\nAirport surveillance video showed the airplane at low altitude and appeared to climb until it overflew airport hangars.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilots reported the engine suddenly lost power during the initial takeoff climb at an altitude of 300 to 400 ft above ground level (agl) during the instructional flight. The loss of engine power was not preceded by any abnormal signs or engine indications. The instructor took over control of the airplane and attempted a forced landing in the grass near the runway.

Corrosion that was discovered on both magnetos was attributed to the airplane being stored outside in a hot humid environment after the accident in the months leading up to the full examination.  No other mechanical irregularities were discovered, and a maintenance logbook review did not reveal recent maintenance that may have been related to the sudden loss of engine power. &#x0D;\nBased on witness statements and signatures of the wreckage, the instructor likely did not maintain adequate airspeed during the forced landing attempt, which resulted in an aerodynamic stall and extremely hard landing.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On October 17, 2023, at 1050 eastern daylight time, a Tecnam P2010, N118T, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at Ocala International Airport-Jim Taylor Field (OCF), Ocala, Florida. The flight instructor and the private pilot were seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nShortly after arrival in OCF following an uneventful cross-country flight, the pilots fueled the airplane with about 27 gallons of fuel before preparing for their return flight to Lakeland Linder International Airport (LAL) Lakeland, Florida. According to the private pilot who was undergoing instrument instruction, they taxied to runway 36 (which was 7,467 ft-long), held short of the runway, and performed an engine run-up on the taxiway. All indications were normal as the engine operated for about 10 minutes while they awaited their takeoff clearance. The controller cleared the pilot for a full-length departure with a right downwind departure to the south.&#x0D;\nDuring the initial takeoff climb, as the airplane reached 300 to 400 ft agl, the engine suddenly “quit.” The loss of engine power was not preceded by any abnormal engine indications. The flight instructor reported that she immediately took control of the airplane and attempted a forced landing straight ahead in the grass northeast of runway 36. The airplane was descending quickly and when the instructor attempted to flare for landing, the airplane did not respond. Neither pilot recalled hearing the stall warning horn. &#x0D;\nWitnesses observed the airplane during the climb and reported that after the loss of power the airplane appeared to be going slow and not climbing, with one witness stating that the pilot did “not lower the nose.” During the attempted landing, the witnesses further stated they did not hear the engine operating, and the airplane appeared to bank left immediately before impact. Security camera footage showed the airplane descending in a wings-level attitude and, immediately before impact, the left wing dropped. The airplane impacted the terrain in a left-wing-low, nose-down attitude and skidded to a stop. The instructor stated she did not apply a left control input during short final and did not remember the airplane turning left before impact. The airplane’s stall speed with flaps in the stowed and takeoff position was 59 kts and 53 kts respectively.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the wreckage by an FAA inspector revealed substantial damage to the airframe; both wings were deformed downwards at the wing root, and the forward fuselage was crushed. Damage to the engine compartment prevented a detailed examination of the engine at the accident scene. About 55 gallons of aviation fuel was recovered from the airplane. The cockpit flap toggle switch mount was damaged but appeared to be in the UP (retracted) position. The flaps and actuators were substantially damaged during impact.  &#x0D;\nA subsequent examination was conducted at the aircraft salvage facility four months later. Crankshaft and valvetrain continuity were confirmed throughout the engine and through the rear accessory case by rotating the propeller. The fuel selector was clear and functioned normally, and the fuel filter was clean. The fuel filter housing was full of aviation fuel. The spark plugs displayed normal coloration and normal electrodes as compared to the Champion Aerospace AV-27 Check-A-Plug chart. &#x0D;\nThe magnetos were removed, and an electric drill was used to spin the input driveshafts. No spark was generated on either magneto. After about two minutes of spinning the left magneto at high rpm, the magneto started to intermittently spark and then sparked normally on all leads after that. The right magneto never sparked. Both magnetos were opened for examination and both exhibited corrosion features on the coils and frame. &#x0D;\nA review of airframe and engine maintenance records revealed that the left and right magnetos were removed on June 24, 2023, about four months before the accident, and temporarily replaced with overhauled units. The removed magnetos were sent out and underwent a 500-hour inspection, cleaning, repair and successful bench test on July 10, 2023. On October 6, 2023, 11 days before the accident, the temporary magnetos were removed, and the original magnetos were returned to service and placed back on the original airplane. &#x0D;\nThe maintenance records also revealed that on December 6, 2022, at 1,084.8 hours total time engine the No. 2 cylinder failed a compression check. A subsequent examination and engine run on January 4, 2023, confirmed adequate compression and the engine was signed off as airworthy. Subsequent 400-, 100-, 50- and 25-hr inspections were accomplished from February 16, 2023, at 1,084.8 hours total time through the 500-hour magneto inspection/rocker arm gasket replacements on October 9, 2023, at 1,685.8 hours total engine time. &#x0D;\nOn October 16, 2023, the day before the accident, a pilot “squawk” was documented stating that the engine gas temperature “runs a bit high.” The issue was verified but the airplane was noted as safe to fly. -",

During the descent and approach, the air traffic controller informed the pilot that runway 5 was closed; however, the pilot proceeded to land, and the airplane impacted a barricade and ground equipment, which resulted in substantial damage to the left wing.&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine found excessive combustion products on the No. 4 cylinder exhaust valve. The deposits wore the valve guide, which resulted in the improper seat of the valve, abnormal valve operation, and fatigue failure of the valve face.  &#x0D;\nThe excessive combustion product deposits were most likely due to a rich fuel/air mixture, which prevented the cylinder from reaching the temperature required to ensure that lead combustion products were expelled from the cylinder with the exhaust gas.  Review of the airplane’s maintenance records revealed that the engine was 15 days overdue for an annual inspection. Had the required inspection had been performed on time, the exhaust valve issues likely would have been discovered before the accident occurred.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On October 15, 2023, about 0951 central daylight time, a Cirrus SR22 airplane, N6JA, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at Red Oak Municipal Airport (RDK), Red Oak, Iowa. The pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nADS-B flight track information revealed that the airplane departed Eppley Airfield (OMA), Omaha, Nebraska, at 0920 and climbed to 7,000 ft mean sea level (msl) enroute to St Louis Downtown Airport (CPS), St Louis, Illinois.&#x0D;\nThe pilot encountered icing conditions at 7,000 ft msl and requested a climb from air traffic control (ATC) to 9,000 ft msl. After climbing above the clouds into visual meteorological conditions, the engine began to run rough and engine power indications began to fluctuate.&#x0D;\nThe pilot diverted to RDK, a non-tower-controlled airport, and flew the RNAV (GPS) runway 5 approach. During the descent and arrival to RDK, the controller informed the pilot twice that runway 5 was closed. The pilot proceeded to land on runway 5, and the airplane impacted a barricade and ground equipment, which resulted in substantial damage to the left wing.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the engine and subsequent laboratory testing by the National Transportation Safety Board Materials Lab revealed that the No. 4 cylinder exhaust valve failed as a result of wear of the exhaust valve guide. The wear of the valve guide caused the valve to seat improperly, which led to valve head deformation, hard contact of the valve head with the valve seat, and failure of the exhaust valve rotocoil. A portion of the valve face exited the No. 4 cylinder through the exhaust system and entered the left side turbocharger assembly. The exhaust turbine blades received damage along the leading blade edges before the valve face exited through the left side exhaust. The fractured valve face was not recovered. &#x0D;\nThe No. 4 exhaust valve head was fractured. The combustion face was covered with combustion products and some regions exhibited a red/purple tint. The fracture initiated in the fillet on the downstream-facing side of the valve head and progressed through the head to the combustion face. The origin sustained some post-fracture impact damage, but there were no apparent pre-existing anomalies at the crack origin. The valve head’s seat face was worn and the valve head was dished/mushroomed and the valve stem displayed a buildup of combustion products below the region that engaged the valve guide &#x0D;\nThe No. 4 exhaust rotocoil was worn and the race was covered in cooked oil except for a 0.080-inch-wide annular track that the spring contacted. The spring was worn flat on the side that contacted the washer. &#x0D;\nBorescope examinations of the remaining cylinders showed that the No. 6 cylinder exhaust valve face displayed uneven heat damage consistent with a failing valve. &#x0D;\nReview of the airframe and engine maintenance records showed that the airplane’s most recent annual inspection was completed on September 25, 2022.&#x0D;\nRDK was equipped with three runways; runway 5/23, which was 5,100 ft long by 75 ft wide; runway 17/35, which was 2,901 ft long by 60 ft wide; and runway 13/31, which was grass and measured 2,050 ft long by 210 ft wide. GPS instrument approach procedures were available for runways 5 and 17. -",

The student pilot sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe airplane departed from Cape Fear Regional Airport/Howie Franklin Field Airport (SUT), Oak Island, North Carolina.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, he conducted a preflight inspection and did not notice any issues with the airplane. He then started the engine, brought it up to operating temperature and taxied from the east ramp via taxiway “C” to Taxiway “A,” and then to runway 5. &#x0D;\nHe then conducted an engine run-up, and all systems checked “green.” He then departed from runway 5; however, shortly after takeoff the airplane experienced a total loss of engine power. &#x0D;\nThe pilot then followed the engine out procedures, glided over the trees at the north end of the runway, and landed in a vacant lot. During the landing, the left wing struck a palm tree, and the airplane spun around before it came to rest. &#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that during the impact sequence with the tree, the left wing with the exception of the wing spar had separated from its mounting location, the fuselage had torn and accordioned crushed at the left wing root fuselage juncture, and the left landing gear had collapsed and folded back along the left side of the fuselage. The right wing also displayed crush and compression damage along its length, and the right outboard portion was missing the wingtip and was crushed back. The area of the right wing root fuselage juncture also displayed tearing and crush damage. &#x0D;\nThe recorded weather at SUT, at 0745, included: wind 300° at 5 knots, 10 miles visibility, clear skies, temperature 13° C, dew point 10° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.65 inches of mercury. &#x0D;\nAccording to FAA records, the pilot held a student pilot certificate. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on August 3, 2022. He reported that he had accrued approximately 101 total flight hours.&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA and maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 2008. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on July 18, 2023.

    "PrelimNarrative": "On October 12, 2023, about 1521 central daylight time, a Cessna 414 airplane, N880A, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Patterson, Louisiana. The commercial pilot and the pilot-rated passenger sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 cross-country flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the passenger’s family, the purpose of the flight was for the passenger to travel to Houston, Texas, for a medical appointment. The pilot, who was also the airplane owner, was a flight instructor for both single and multi-engine airplanes. The passenger held a private pilot certificate, for single engine airplanes.&#x0D;\nA review of Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) data showed that the airplane departed from the Gonzales Regional Airport (REG), Gonzales, Louisiana, at 1456. Prior to the departure at REG, that pilot added 64.57 gallons of fuel to the airplane The airplane landed at 1511, at the Harry P. Williams Memorial Airport (PTN), Patterson, Louisiana. According to the PTN airport manager, the airplane taxied over to the fixed-base operator, the airplane remained at idle, and the passenger boarded the airplane. The passenger pulled a rolling suitcase out to the airplane. Once the passenger boarded, the pilot then got out of the airplane and walked over to the left side of the airplane where he appeared to look at the something on the airplane. The pilot then boarded then airplane and taxied to runway 24 for departure. The pilot announced on the airport common traffic advisory frequency that the airplane was departing runway 24, and no further radio transmissions were heard from the airplane. The ADS-B data did not capture the airplane taking off.&#x0D;\nA witness, who was driving in her vehicle near an intersection just to the west of PTN, observed the airplane shortly after it departed from runway 24. She observed the airplane was “tilted to the left,” it turned on its side, and then entered a nosedive. She observed the airplane impact a sugarcane field, where upon impact, an explosion occurred, and the wreckage and surrounding area was on fire. She could not tell if the airplane’s engines were emitting any abnormal noises prior to impact as she was driving at the time, nor did she observe any smoke or flames emit from the airplane prior to impacting the sugarcane field. She additionally reported, that from her position, it did not appear that the airplane was trying to turn around back to the airport.&#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest about 0.32 miles southwest from the departure end of runway 24. The accident site was located on private property, that consisted of sugarcane, about 12 ft tall. The wreckage was destroyed from the postimpact fire. All major structural components of the airplane were located at the accident site. The wreckage was recovered from the accident site, and it was transported to a secure location for further examination.&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe revealed flight control continuity. The elevator trim tab appeared to be in a significant airplane nose up position. While most of the airframe fuel system was destroyed, both fuel tank selectors were found in the main fuel tank positions. The flaps and the main landing gear were found in the retracted position.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with two Continental Motors TSIO-520-NCNB reciprocating engines. Examination of the right engine revealed five fractured valve springs:&#x0D;\nThe #1 cylinder intake (inner spring).&#x0D;\nThe #1 cylinder exhaust (outer spring).&#x0D;\nThe #2 cylinder intake (outer spring).&#x0D;\nThe #4 cylinder intake (outer spring).&#x0D;\nThe #4 cylinder intake (inner spring). &#x0D;\nThe five fractured valve springs were shipped to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for further examination. Examination of the left engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with two Hartzell Propeller PHC-C3YF-2UF/F7693DFB aluminum controllable pitch propellers (known as the Scimitar Plus model). Both propellers were found separated from the engines and were buried in the mud. Both propellers exhibited signatures consistent with rotation at the time of impact, although neither propeller appeared to be feathered.&#x0D;\nDuring a review of the maintenance records, a customer invoice dated July 20, 2023, was identified, and was noted to include multiple maintenance discrepancies with the airplane that were not resolved within that work order. One of the unresolved discrepancies included, “the right-hand tachometer is not indicating.” The maintenance records indicated that the airframe, the engines, and the propellers had an annual inspection performed on April 1, 2023.&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot purchased the airplane in May 2018, and it was based in southern Louisiana. According to FAA Advisory Circular 43-4B Corrosion Control for Aircraft, southern Louisiana is classified as a severe corrosion zone.&#x0D;\nThe Cessna Model 414 Owner’s Manual discusses an engine failure during takeoff and states:&#x0D;\nThe most critical time for an engine failure in a multi-engine aircraft is during a two or three second period late in the takeoff run while the aircraft is accelerating to a safe engine failure speed.&#x0D;\nThe Cessna Pilot Safety and Warning Supplements discusses single engine flight information (for multi-engine airplanes) and states in part:&#x0D;\nEach time a pilot considers a takeoff in a twin-engine airplane, knowledge is required of the Minimum Control Speed (VMC) for that particular airplane. Knowledge of this speed, is essential to ensure safe operation of the airplane in the event an engine power loss occurs during the most critical phases of flight, the takeoff and initial climb.",

    "FactualNarrative": "On October 12, 2023, about 0250 mountain daylight time, a Cessna 340A airplane, N682JS, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at Boise Air Terminal/Gowen Field, (BOI) Boise, Idaho. The pilot was not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 repositioning flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that, while taxiing for departure, the right brake failed while he was attempting to stop the airplane. The airplane veered left and subsequently impacted the airport perimeter fence, resulting in a fire when the left wingtip fuel tank was breached. &#x0D;\nExamination of the airplane’s brake system revealed continuity to each wheel brake and appropriate servicing of the brakes’ cylinders. The brakes were cycled, activated, and released appropriately. The wheels and tires were examined, and no anomalies were noted. Examination of the nose wheel steering system was accomplished by jacking up the nose wheel and verifying proper nosewheel and rudder deflection. There was no evidence of a failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. &#x0D;\nA review of airport surveillance video captured the airplane taxiing and the impact with the fence. In the seconds before impact, the airplane did not noticeably slow down or change direction. The video indicated that the airplane was traveling the same direction and gradually drifted to the left until the wingtip tank made contact with the fence and the airplane pivoted around the left wingtip, which became embedded in the fence. There was a tire skid mark right of the taxi throughway that was offset about the distance of the airplane’s right main landing gear tire. The black skid mark was narrow and veered to the left across the centerline and into the area of the fence impact, consistent with the airplane’s right main tire being side-loaded and not locked. No other tire skid markings were noted in the area. -",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On October 11, 2023, about 2130 eastern daylight time, a Cirrus SR-22, N253BC, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Martinsville, Virginia. The pilot and three passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nThe pilot refueled the airplane, completed a preflight inspection, updated the airplane’s electronic flight instrument system, and departed Blue Ridge Airport (MTV), Martinsville, Virginia, for a night, visual flight rules cross-country flight to Oklahoma. The pilot reported that on takeoff, after he established a positive rate of climb at an airspeed of 95 kts, he retracted the flaps, which had been set to 50°. Shortly thereafter, he reported that the primary flight display blinked off momentarily and then reappeared with a “Taxiway! Taxiway!” banner. He looked at the multifunction flight display and noted that it was “completely orange” and appeared to depict an autopilot track turning directly left, which made him wonder if the autopilot was engaged. He further reported that it was “an extremely dark evening” and he “just happened to look up” and saw that the airplane was flying directly toward a large pine tree. He attempted to avoid the tree; however, the airplane struck trees to the left of the departure end of the runway. The pilot was able to maintain control of the airplane and the engine was developing full power as it continued to climb to the traffic pattern altitude. The pilot stated that the airplane was very “shaky,” and he was unable to see the altitude on the primary flight display. He was not certain if the autopilot was engaged, so he repeatedly pressed the autopilot disconnect button. He circled back toward MTV, trimmed the airplane for landing, and made a safe landing on runway 13, after which he immediately cleared the runway and shut off the engine. &#x0D;\nExamination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings. The inspector also observed that the pitch trim was set in the full nose-up position. &#x0D;\nThe airplane was retained for further examination.",

The air transport pilot and passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that the purpose of the flight was for the accident airplane to be photographed by another pilot in a different airplane. The pilot stated that during the preflight he noted there was about 35 gallons of fuel onboard. After a normal run-up, the pilot departed runway 22R. Durning the initial climb, when the airplane was about 5 miles from the departure end of the runway at an altitude of about 1,500 ft above ground level (agl), the engine experienced a partial loss of power. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot declared an emergency to air traffic control and made 180° degree turn to return back to the airport. The airplane was unable to maintain sufficient altitude and the pilot elected to retract the landing gear in an effort to reduce the drag. The pilot touched down in a dirt area about 500 ft short of the threshold for runway 04R. The airplane came to ret upright and sustained damage to the left aileron.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector that responded to the accident stated that the fuel tanks were intact. He drained about 0.5 gallons from each wing tank. He turned the airplane power on, noted that the airplane’s fuel gauges read empty and the JPI engine monitor indicated that 32 gallons remained. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA post accident examination was conducted by a certified mechanic under the auspice of the FAA inspector. The fuel line was disconnected at the engine-driven fuel pump. No signs of fluid were observed during the disconnection. A clean, flexible hose was attached to the fuel line and plumbed to a 5-gallon container. The master switch was activated supplying power to the airplane. Both boost pumps were activated on their high and low settings and could be heard operating. No fuel egressed from the lines.  There were no tripped or \"popped\" circuit breakers. The fuel sump drains from the left and right hopper tanks were removed. About six ounces of fuel was observed to flow out during the removal. There was no other fluid found in the system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe JPI instrument was removed for further investigation.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Both pilots reported that they were sharing flying responsibilities during the night cross-country flights to build flight time. The pilot in the left seat was performing the takeoffs and landings, while the pilot in the right seat flew the en route portion of the flights. Before departing on the accident flight, the pilots added 15 gallons of fuel, which brought the right fuel tank to full and the left fuel tank to about half to three-fourths full. The pilot in the left seat departed with the fuel selector position to the left tank (the fuel selector handle was located on the left side of the cockpit). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs they neared the destination airport of the planned 1 hour 47-minute flight, the pilot in the left seat switched the fuel selector from left tank to right tank. At that time, the left fuel tank would have been nearly empty after departing with that tank half full and drawing from it for the entire accident flight. Shortly thereafter, the engine lost all power. She performed the emergency checklist items but was unable to restart the engine while the pilot in the right seat continued flying the airplane. The airplane was unable to glide to the nearest airport and they performed a forced landing into trees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage revealed that it came to rest nose-down in a wooded area. Both wing fuel tanks were breached and there was no fuel odor or browning of vegetation at the accident site. The left-wing fuel cap remained secured; however, the right-wing fuel cap was missing and was not located at the accident site. Based on this information, it is likely that the right-wing fuel cap was not secured before departure and, during the accident flight, fuel siphoned from the right tank without either pilot noticing. The loose or missing right fuel cap was not identified during the preflight inspection of the airplane nor was the resulting fuel imbalance identified during the flight.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On October 10, 2023, about 2230 eastern daylight time, a Piper PA-28-140, N55162, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Jonesboro, Georgia. The private pilot and commercial pilot were seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe private pilot/owner reported that she was in the left seat. The commercial pilot was in the right seat and the flying pilot (pilot-in-command) as they were alternating legs to build flight time. The pilot in the left seat made radio calls while the pilot in the right seat flew. They planned to fly from Destin Executive Airport (DTS), Destin, Florida, to Hartsfield – Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Atlanta, Georgia. Before departing DTS, they purchased 15 gallons of fuel. Five gallons of fuel completely filled the right fuel tank (25 gallons), and the remaining 10 gallons were added to the left fuel tank. The total fuel onboard was determined to be 38 gallons by using a measuring stick in the left fuel tank (13 gallons) and visually confirming a full right fuel tank. She added that the other pilot also checked the fuel quantity by visual inspection. They departed at 2018 with a planned flying time of 1 hour and 47 minutes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot in the left seat added that as they were nearing ATL, at 3,500 ft mean sea level, she switched from the left fuel tank to the right fuel tank (the fuel selector was located on the left side of the cockpit). Shortly thereafter, the engine lost all power. She performed the emergency checklist items but was unable to restart the engine while the pilot in the right seat continued to fly the airplane. The airplane was unable to glide to the nearest airport and they performed a forced landing into trees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe commercial pilot in the right seat reported that the private pilot/owner in the left seat was pilot-in-command. She further stated that the private pilot in the left seat performed the takeoffs and landings, while she flew the en route portion of the flight from the right seat, as they were both building flight time. She added that the airplane landed at DTS with a fuel load about half full. They purchased 15 gallons of fuel, which brought the fuel load to nearly full (full right tank of 25 gallons and left tank 18.5 out of 25 gallons). The pilot in the left seat reported that she was taking off with the fuel selector positioned to the left fuel tank. After the accident, the pilot in the left seat stated that she forgot to switch fuel tanks throughout the accident flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of a pilot operating handbook for the accident airplane make and model revealed that the engine consumed 8.4 gallons of fuel per hour at 75% power, which equated to about half the total capacity of the left wing fuel tank during the accident flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed that the wreckage came to rest nose-down in a wooded area. Both wings and the fuselage sustained substantial damage. Both wing fuel tanks were breached and there was no fuel odor or browning of vegetation at the accident site. The inspector observed that the left wing fuel cap remained secured; however, the right wing fuel cap was missing, and he could not locate it at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs of the publication of this report, no insurance coverage has been identified and the wreckage has not been recovered from the wooded area. -",

The runway in use was runway 05, and a preceding aircraft reported a direct crosswind. The initial approach and landing were uneventful. When the airplane touched down and all three wheels were on the ground, an unexpected gust of wind lifted the left wing and started pushing the airplane towards the right. The airplane exited the runway into the grass. The wind then lifted the tail of the airplane and it nosed over onto the vertical stabilizer. The fuselage and empennage of the airplane were substantially damaged. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane, that would have precluded normal operation.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On October 4, 2023, about 23:47 eastern daylight time, Federal Express (FedEx) flight 1376, a Boeing 757-236, experienced a failure with its left hydraulic system shortly after takeoff from Chattanooga Metropolitan Airport-Lovell Field (CHA), Chattanooga, Tennessee. The airplane turned back to CHA, and, while preparing to land, the landing gear failed to extend normally. The landing gear also failed to extend using the alternate extend system. The flight crew declared an emergency and the airplane sustained substantial damage during the emergency landing. The two flight crew members and the jump seat occupant aboard the airplane were not injured. The flight was operating under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 as a non-scheduled domestic cargo flight from CHA to Memphis International Airport (MEM), Memphis, Tennessee.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight crew reported that the airplane had no maintenance issues before the flight and that the push-back, engine start, and taxi were all uneventful. The captain was the pilot flying, and the first officer was the pilot monitoring. Digital flight data recorder (DFDR) data showed that the airplane departed CHA about 22:24.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the flight crew, after rotation and confirmation of a positive rate of climb, the first officer (FO) raised the landing gear control lever to retract the landing gear. DFDR data showed that both the main gear and the nose gear retracted to their up and locked position. About 1 minute later, the flap handle was positioned in its up (flaps 0) position.  The flight crew reported that immediately thereafter, a “TE FLAP DISAGREE” message was displayed on the engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS), along with an associated master caution light, a “TRAILING EDGE” discrete light, and the aural alert caution beeper. Per the captain's direction, the FO began accomplishing the “TE FLAP DISAGREE” checklist in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FO was able to retract the flaps to their up position via alternate means in accordance with the appropriate checklist contained in the QRH. While completing this checklist, the flight crew received an “L HYD SYS PRESS” EICAS message at 22:24:33 at an altitude of about 1978 ft above ground level (agl). The status page showed that the left hydraulic system fluid quantity was near zero and that the system was not pressurized. The captain directed the FO to run the QRH checklist for “L HYD SYS PRESS”. The flight crew decided to return to CHA.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUpon positioning the landing gear control lever to its down position to extend the gear for landing, the flight crew received a gear unsafe indication via illumination of the amber “GEAR” disagreement light and a “GEAR DISAGREE” message on the EICAS. Also, the lack of illumination of the three green landing gear indicator lights indicated that the gear was not down and locked.  The FO then conducted the “Alternate Gear Extension” procedure embedded in the L HYD SYS PRESS checklist, which was unsuccessful. After multiple attempts to lower the landing gear, the flight crew declared an emergency.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight crewmembers asked Chattanooga approach if they could conduct a low approach over the runway so that tower personnel could visually confirm the position of the landing gear. The airplane descended to about 150 ft agl and flew the length of the runway, which was followed by a go-around. Approach control relayed confirmation that the landing gear was not in the down position. Subsequently, the flight crew completed the deferred items on the “GEAR UNSAFE” QRH checklist and the airplane was cleared to land on runway 20.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight crewmembers reported that during the initial touchdown, the airplane bounced slightly but they were able to maintain directional control and the runway’s centerline. The flight crew was unable to stop the airplane and it slid off the departure end of runway 20 and impacted localizer antennas before coming to rest about 830 ft beyond the end of the runway, (see figure 1).&#x0D;\n\t&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Airplane in its final resting position.  (Source: Chattanooga Fire Department).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the airplane came to a complete stop, the flight crew performed the “EVACUATION” checklist, and the jump seat occupant attempted to open the left-hand door (L1). The door rotated halfway open and then became bound, and the slide did not deploy (figure 2, upper photo). The jump seat occupant then attempted to open the right-hand door (R1), but it became lodged on the packing of the raft/slide.  The jump seat occupant subsequently forced the door open, and the slide deployed. The flight crew and the jump seat occupant then egressed the airplane via the R1 door/slide (figure 2, lower photo).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2.  Photos of the airplane in its final resting position.  (Source for upper photo: Chattanooga Fire Department; source for lower photo Federal Aviation Administration.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the left main landing gear door actuator retract port hose was leaking hydraulic fluid (see figure 3). The hose was removed and retained by the NTSB for further investigation. The examination also found a discontinuity in the wiring of the landing gear alternate extension system.  The section of that wire was retained for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Left MLG door actuator showing the area of leakage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following NTSB specialists were assigned to investigate the accident: systems, survival factors, cockpit voice recorder (CVR), and DFDR. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Express, The Boeing Company, Safran Evacuation Systems, and the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) are parties to the investigation.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe DFDR and the CVR were removed from the airplane and shipped to the NTSB’s Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for download of the data. The DFDR was downloaded, and a review of the preliminary data indicates that the left hydraulic system began losing pressure shortly after takeoff.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe CVR was downloaded, and the data are currently being analyzed.  &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe investigation is continuing.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The flight instructor , pilot receiving instruction, and the pilot-rated passenger departed in the multi-engine airplane to conduct flight training. The training syllabus for the flight included a review of stalls, slow flight, steep turns and single-engine emergencies that included  minimum control airspeed (Vmc) procedures. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot-rated passenger, who was seated in the right rear seat, reported that the pilot receiving instruction was at the controls and was performing a Vmc maneuver when the loss of control occurred. At the start of the maneuver, at about 5300 ft mean sea level (msl), the pilot receiving instruction was flying the airplane. The passenger stated that during the maneuver the stall horn sounded, and the airplane almost immediately went “inverted to the left.” When the airplane entered a spin, the pilot receiving instruction verbalized the steps to return the airplane to level flight/recover from the spin and subsequently requested the flight instructor take over the flight controls. Numerous witnesses reported seeing the airplane spiraling as it disappeared from view.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVmc is the speed below which aircraft directional control cannot be maintained if the critical engine fails. During a Vmc demonstration, power is reduced on the critical engine (left) and the airplane is recovered before the loss of directional control or a stall. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the recovered airframe and engines revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit to all primary flight controls. Numerous separations were noted within the flight control system with signatures consistent with overload separation or due to the recovery process. In addition, the passenger stated she was not aware of any mechanical issues with the airplane.&#x0D;\nThe recorded ADS-B flight track data, recorded engine data, passenger’s statement, and witness interviews were consistent with the airplane having stalled and entered a spiral from which the pilots did not recover.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3C), Vmc is the minimum control speed with the critical engine inoperative. To perform a Vmc demonstration maneuver, the handbook indicates, in part, a pilot is to reduce power on the left engine to idle, as the right engine power is advanced to a takeoff setting. As the airplane slows, a bank toward the operating engine is established and rudder pressure is used to maintain directional control. According to the handbook, \"The moment the pilot first recognizes the uncontrollable yaw, or experiences any symptom associated with a stall, the pilot simultaneously retards the throttle for the operating engine to stop the yaw and lowers the pitch attitude to regain speed.\" - The airplane was equipped with a J. P. Instruments EDM-960 that can monitor and record multiple engine parameters related to twin-engine operations. The engine monitor was removed and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board’s (NTSB) Vehicle Recorder Laboratory. The memory chip was removed from the impact-damaged unit and the data was downloaded from the EDM. The downloaded engine data included 44 sessions from July 21, 2023, to October 3, 2023.

The flight instructor and the pilot receiving instruction were fatally injured; a pilot-rated rear-seated passenger was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA representative from the operator reported that the pilot receiving instruction had recently obtained a commercial pilot certificate with an airplane single-engine land rating and the accident flight was his first flight in his multi-engine training program. They added that it is common for the first multi-engine training flight to include slow flight, power-off stalls, power-on stalls, accelerated stalls, steep turns, and a Vmc demonstration.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot-rated passenger reported that she had recently completed ground training for her multi-engine rating, and on the day of the accident flight, she had been invited to observe the multi-engine training session. During the accident flight, she was seated in the rear right seat, behind the flight instructor. With the pilot receiving instruction flying the airplane, she observed a series of maneuvers, including slow flight, emergency descent, steep turns, and stalls, followed by a Vmc demonstration. Unable to see all the airplane’s flight controls from her position, she believed the airplane’s left engine was set to idle, the landing gear was retracted, and the flaps were in a cruise configuration. During the Vmc demonstration, the stall warning sounded, and the airplane almost immediately went inverted to the left. Initially, the pilot receiving instruction remained on the flight controls, verbalizing the steps he was taking to try to stop the spin, but she could not understand what he was saying. The pilot receiving instruction then asked the flight instructor to take control of the airplane, which he did. The pilot receiving instruction then asked the flight instructor if he should run a checklist, and the flight instructor replied “yes.” In the final seconds it became clear to the passenger that they were not going to recover and that they were going to crash. She did not recall impacting terrain. The pilot-rated passenger was not aware of any mechanical issues, but she did not participate in the preflight inspection of the accident airplane. During the accident flight, she did not notice any mechanical defects.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADS-B data showed that the airplane departed Portland-Hillsboro Airport (HIO) at 0118:21 and ascended to 1,200 ft msl before entering a left turn. The airplane continued on a westerly heading and ascended to an altitude of about 3,400 ft msl. At 0125:35 the airplane made a left turn to the south and ascended to an altitude of 5,300 ft msl. At 0130:46 the airplane made a left 180° turn to the north, then made a right turn to the northeast. The data showed the airplane continued on a northeast heading for about 3 minutes before a series of 360° turns to the left and right were performed. At the completion of the turns, the airplane turned to the southwest. The data showed that at 0143:48, the airplane made a left turn to the southeast. While on a southeasterly heading, the airplane’s ground speed began to decrease from 133 kts. At 0145:56 the data showed the airplane’s ground speed had decreased to 69 kts, at an altitude of 5,750 ft msl, and began to descend on a southeasterly heading. The last recorded ADS-B target, at 0146:38, was located about 50 ft northwest of the accident site at an altitude of 525 ft, as seen in Figure 1. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: View of accident airplane flight track.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to multiple witnesses near the accident site, the airplane was in level flight before it pitched downward and entered a near-vertical descent. The airplane continued in a nose-low, near-vertical descent until the airplane went out of visual range. Several witnesses described the airplane as “spinning” or “spiraling” during various phases of the vertical descent. Video recorded by one of the witnesses shows the airplane spiraling as it descended. - An autopsy of the flight instructor and pilot receiving instruction was performed by the Oregon State Medical Examiner. The autopsy report was reviewed by the NTSB Investigator-In-Charge. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was blunt force injuries due to a plane crash.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing for the flight instructor and the pilot receiving instruction was performed at the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Forensic Sciences Laboratory and found no drugs of abuse. - Examination of the accident site revealed that the airplane impacted a single-story residential structure, substantially damaging the fuselage and wings. The airplane came to rest in a near-vertical attitude in the residential structure, on a heading of about 285° magnetic and at an elevation of 249 ft msl. No visible ground scars were observed surrounding the wreckage. All major structural components of the airplane were located within about 10 ft of the main wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the recovered airframe and engines did not reveal evidence of any mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit to all primary flight controls. Numerous separations were noted within the flight control system with signatures consistent with overload separation or due to the recovery process. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and three family members departed to return to their home airport. The departure was during dark nighttime conditions and into an area with little ambient light for visual reference. A witness statement, confirmed by video evidence, indicated that the pilot did not use the pilot-controlled runway lights and turned off the airplane landing light immediately after takeoff. &#x0D;\nReview of ADS-B data showed that, while at a low altitude, the airplane began a continuous 180° right turn that was described by the witness as steep and descending. &#x0D;\nImpact marks indicated that the pilot likely began a climb or held a nose-up attitude before the airplane’s landing gear struck a hill. The airplane continued beyond this first hill for about 540 ft, where it then descended in a nose-low attitude and impacted a second hill. The impacts fatally injured the occupants and substantially damaged the airplane. &#x0D;\nBefore the accident flight, the pilot received a weather briefing that reported visual meteorological conditions for the departure airport, route of flight, and destination airport. The briefing did not include information on moon rise or illumination. A weather study revealed that, at the time of takeoff, the full moon had not risen completely above the horizon. &#x0D;\nThe pilot did not use the functional pilot-controlled runway lights, thus eliminating this light source as a possible visual aid during the departure. Additionally, a local operator stated that their company pilots do not usually depart on the runway used by the accident pilot at night due to the dark conditions and the lack of visual references. &#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airplane Flying Handbook advised pilots flying at night that, after becoming airborne, the darkness of night often makes it difficult to note whether the airplane is getting closer to or farther from the surface. The handbook also stated to check flight instruments frequently during takeoff to ensure proper airspeed, attitude, and heading, and to climb to a safe maneuvering altitude before turning. The handbook noted that, when using the landing light at night during takeoff, a pilot should turn it off after the climb is well established.&#x0D;\nIt is likely that the pilot neither had adequate visual references after takeoff nor monitored the airplane’s flight instruments appropriately to detect the airplane’s descent during the continuous 180° crosswind to downwind turn. This likely led to the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation, resulting in controlled flight into terrain.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A review of the maintenance logbooks revealed no anomalies.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The Airplane Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3C, Chapter 11 stated, in part:&#x0D;\nThe procedure for night takeoffs is the same as for normal daytime takeoffs except that many of the runway visual cues are not available. The pilot should check the flight instruments frequently during the takeoff to ensure proper airspeed, attitude, and heading. As the airspeed reaches the normal lift-off speed, the pilot adjusts the pitch attitude to establish a normal climb by referring to both outside visual references, such as lights, and to the flight instruments. After becoming airborne, the darkness of night often makes it difficult to note whether the airplane is getting closer to or farther from the surface. The attitude indicator, vertical speed indicator (VSI), and altimeter should all indicate a positive climb. It is also important to ensure the airspeed is at best climb speed.&#x0D;\nThe pilot makes necessary pitch and bank adjustments by referencing the attitude and heading indicators. It is recommended that turns not be made until reaching a safe maneuvering altitude. Although the use of the landing lights is helpful during the takeoff, they become ineffective after the airplane has climbed to an altitude where the light beam no longer extends to the surface. The light can cause distortion when it is reflected by haze, smoke, or clouds that might exist in the climb. Therefore, when the landing light is used for the takeoff, it should be turned off after the climb is well established provided it is not being used for collision avoidance. - A review of maintenance records revealed that the engine was overhauled on October 19, 2019. The last annual inspection of the airframe, engine, and propeller occurred on March 20, 2023, at a tachometer time of 1842.78 hours and a total time of 4642.78 hours. - CNY was located about 16 statute miles northwest of the nearest city of Moab, Utah. The area surrounding CNY was mostly unpopulated.    &#x0D;\nAccording to the airport manager, an inspection of the runway confirmed that the pilot-controlled runway lights were operational around the time of the departure. - On October 1, 2023, about 2024 mountain daylight time, A Piper PA-28-140, N7153R, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Moab, Utah. The pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAn airport security video recorded the airplane landing at 1747 at the Canyonlands Regional Airport (CNY), Moab, Utah. According to a fixed-base-operator employee, the pilot purchased 27 gallons of fuel, parked the airplane near the fuel island, and departed the airport with his family. The occupants returned later in the evening and boarded the airplane. At 2022:47, ADS-B data showed the airplane on runway 21. The security video showed that the pilot-controlled runway lights were not illuminated at that time. At 2023:39, ADS-B data showed the airplane was about mid-runway when it departed the runway surface. At 2024:18, ADS-B data showed the airplane had drifted left of the runway centerline and had begun a right turn, about 400 ft beyond the departure end of the runway at an altitude of about 4,500 ft mean sea level (msl). &#x0D;\nA witness, located near the departure end of runway 21, reported that he saw the airplane take off to the southwest. He stated that the runway lights were not on and that the engine was loud and smooth. The witness further saw “the light in the nose turn off,” and stated that the airplane wasn’t very high when it turned steeply to the right and stayed in the steep bank until it was parallel with the runway but in the opposite direction. The witness said that, based upon a reference light from a tower, the red light of the airplane appeared to be losing altitude before he lost sight of it and heard two sounds that were about one second apart. After the second sound, there was no longer an engine sound. The last ADS-B data point recorded around 2024 captured the airplane about 715 ft southwest of the accident site at an altitude of about 4300 ft msl, or zero ft above ground level. According to the owner of the ADS-B data provider, the reported altitude had an uncertainty of ±200 ft. - An autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Office of the Medical Examiner, Utah Department of Health and Human Services. The autopsy report was reviewed by the NTSB Investigator-In-Charge. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was blunt force injuries, and the manner of death was accident.&#x0D;\nThe autopsy revealed mild coronary artery disease, which posed a slight hazard to flight safety. There was no forensic evidence that it likely contributed to this accident. - The pilot requested a weather briefing from ForeFlight. He listed the destination as Casper/Natrona County International Airport (CPR), Casper, Wyoming, and indicated the departure would occur around 2000. Visual meteorological conditions were reported for the departure, route of flight, and destination. &#x0D;\nA weather study revealed that moon rise occurred about 2023. Around 2027, the center of the moon’s disk was about 0.32° above the horizon. - A review of the pilot’s logbook revealed that he recorded a total of 44.8 hours of night flying experience. The last recorded night flights were September 27-28, 2023, for a total of 3.6 hours.&#x0D;\nThe pilot was a member of the South Dakota Army Reserve National Guard (SDARNG). A review of his individual flight records revealed that he had a total of 1,777.8 hours flight experience in military helicopters, but no record of fixed-wing flight experience with the SDARNG. - The airplane came to rest on a hill at an elevation of about 4649 ft msl, on a heading of about 200° magnetic. A line of debris that included the nose and main landing gear assembly extended southwest about 540 ft and included two impact points. The first point of probable impact was a 12 ft by 24-inch gouge/indentation on a hill, at an elevation of about 4635 ft msl, and was consistent with only the nose landing gear impacting the terrain. About 50 ft northeast of this point were indications of contact by the right and then the left main landing gear. About 540 ft away was a second impact mark that was within about 40 ft of the final location of the main wreckage (Figure 1).&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 1. Google Earth image showing the first and second points of probable impact, and the location of the landing gear. The blue arrow points in the direction of travel.&#x0D;\nThe fuselage exhibited downward bending of the engine and cowling area. The right wing separated from the fuselage. The left wing remained attached to the fuselage but exhibited substantial damage. The nosewheel separated from the strut and was found in the first impact area. Both main landing gear assemblies, including the struts, separated from the fuselage. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit to the respective primary flight controls. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On October 1, 2023, at 1608 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 177RG, N545PZ, owned and operated by Lake Placid Air Service was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Lake Placid, New York. The pilot and pilot-rated passenger sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 aerial photography flight. &#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was to photograph the accident airplane while airborne for later publication in a magazine article. According to witnesses, there were two airplanes that made up the flight. The lead airplane was a Beech A36 with a photographer onboard, which took off first from runway 32 at Lake Placid Airport (LKP), Lake Placid, New York. The accident airplane took off about 700 feet behind the Beech A36. The pilot/owner was to fly the airplane during the takeoff and climb out, and after joining up in formation, the pilot rated passenger would have taken over the controls and flown the airplane during the photo shoot.&#x0D;\nDuring taxi out, witnesses heard the engine of the accident airplane running when the Beech A36 pulled up next to it. The accident airplane’s engine then shut off, and about 10 seconds later, the engine restarted. During the takeoff roll, a witness described that the engine sounded as if the propeller was set for “climb” and not takeoff, then he heard the engine surge. During the initial climb, the witness further described that the engine did not sound as if it was running at full power. The accident airplane then made a gentle left turn while it was 300 to 400 feet above ground level to join with the Beech A36. As the accident airplane closed to within about 1,000 feet of the Beech A36, it suddenly made a hard right turn back toward the departure airport. During the turn, the pilot of the Beech A36 heard the passenger in the accident airplane transmit on the common traffic advisory frequency, “We have a problem and we’re returning to the airport.”&#x0D;\nThe accident airplane subsequently impacted an embankment in a right-wing, nose-low attitude about 15 feet below the top of a plateau on airport property. The airplane then slid about 30-feet down the embankment and came to rest on the side of the slope upright, perpendicular to the embankment with its left wing oriented toward the upslope, and its right wing oriented downslope. The initial impact point on the embankment was located about 440 feet from the approach end of runway 14, approximately 250 feet left of the runway centerline. The downslope angle was about 70-degrees with a ravine at its bottom. &#x0D;\nLake Placid Airport was located at an elevation of 1,747 feet above mean sea level, and it was equipped with a single runway in a 14/32, runway configuration. Runway 14/32 was comprised of asphalt that was in good condition, was 4,196 feet-long by 60 feet-wide, and was marked with non-precision markings in good condition that featured a touchdown point. Runway 14 was equipped with medium intensity runway edge lights and a 2-light precision approach path indicator on the left side of the runway which provided a 3.50° glidepath to touchdown. Obstructions existed in the form of 77-foot-high trees located 884 feet from the runway, 334 feet left of centerline, which required an 8:1 slope to clear. Additionally, there were 13-foot-high roads 45 feet and 145 feet from the threshold, and 12-foot-high trees 93 feet from the runway end, located 132 feet to the right of centerline.&#x0D;\nThe recorded weather at Adirondack Regional Airport, Saranac Lake, New York, located about 13 nautical miles northwest of LKP, at 1551, included wind from 010 degrees true at 7 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, clear skies, a temperature of 23° C, a dew point of 12° C, and an altimeter setting of 30.20 inches of mercury. &#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate, with ratings for airplane single-engine land, multiengine land, and instrument airplane. He also possessed a type rating for the DC-3, and private pilot privileges for rotorcraft-helicopter. His most recent FAA-issued second-class medical certificate was issued on January 6, 2023. He reported on that date, that he had accrued approximately 9,000 total flight hours.&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA airworthiness and airplane maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 1976. The airplane's most recent annual inspection was completed on April 7, 2023. At the time of the inspection the airplane had accumulated 5,352.2 total hours of flight time, and the engine had accumulated 36.7 hours of operation since major overhaul.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was examined at the accident site. The right wing had sustained upward buckling from the wingtip inboard to the aileron/flap junction. The fuselage and empennage were slightly buckled along the right side from the aft side of the cabin door to approximately Fuselage Station (FS) 225. Control cable continuity was established from the flight control surfaces to the cockpit controls. The flaps were extended approximately 10 degrees; the stabilator trim was neutral. &#x0D;\nThe fuel strainer bowl was fractured during the impact sequence and only a portion of it was observed. The fuel strainer screen was clean. The fuel selector handle operated normally in all positions and positively engaged in the detents. The position of the fuel selector valve was confirmed to be on “BOTH” by rotating the handle through all positions while defueling the airplane through the inlet line of the fuel strainer. The fuel caps were closed and secured. The position of the fuel pump switch could not be determined due to impact damage. There were no obstructions noted in the fuel or fuel vent system from the wing tanks to the inlet of the fuel strainer. First responders reported fuel was draining from the airplane upon arrival. No blockages were discovered in the fuel system and 17 gallons of fuel were recovered from the right wing fuel tank. The fuel was absent of water contamination.&#x0D;\nThe nose landing gear was crushed aft during the impact sequence and the actuator was separated (its position could not be determined). The main landing gear were in an intermediate position. The single main landing gear actuator was observed attached to its frame. The sector gear teeth were intact. There was no observable damage to the main landing gear down locks or gear legs. The main landing gear wheels were observed in contact with the buckled lower fuselage and not in the wheel wells.&#x0D;\nThe electrical and lighting switch positions were damaged during the impact sequence and their positions could not be determined. The cowl flap handle was in the “OPEN” position. The mixture control was in the full rich position, the propeller control was in the high rpm / fine pitch position, and the throttle was out about 2-inches and bent slightly up and to the left about 30-degrees. &#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the firewall through its respective engine mounts. The engine mount sustained damage from the impact sequence in the form of fractures and bends to various tube sections and was canted to the right of the airplane centerline. The engine mount was cut using a reciprocating saw to free the engine from the firewall along with disconnecting or separating various fuel hoses and control cables.&#x0D;\nThe propeller remained attached to the engine crankshaft. The propeller spinner was impact fractured and only half of it remained attached to the propeller hub. The propeller hub was found cracked and damaged consistent with impact, and one blade was partially dislodged from the hub. The blade exhibited leading edge scratches and gouges. The other blade was bent slightly aft at midspan with an approximate 2-inch curled section of the tip separated. The blade exhibited chordwise scratching and leading edge gouging on the outer 1/3 of the blade.&#x0D;\nThe top sparkplugs were all found intact, undamaged, and tightly installed in each cylinder. The top sparkplugs were removed, and a lighted borescope examination was conducted on each cylinder. No abnormalities were noted within the cylinders. The engine crankshaft was rotated by the propeller in its normal direction of rotation, and suction and compression were noted on all cylinders through the top spark plug holes, with movement of all rocker arms noted during rotation.&#x0D;\nAll 8 sparkplugs were removed and compared to a Champion Aerospace AV-27 “Check-A-Plug” Chart. Coloration across the plugs was from normal to black carbon fouled, with normal wear to the electrodes. No mechanical electrode damage was noted or observed on any of the sparkplugs. The bottom sparkplugs for cylinders No. 1 and No. 3 were oil soaked, consistent with orientation of the engine at the accident site and oil within the cylinders. The single drive dual magneto unit was found securely installed to the rear of the engine, after removal of the unit, the single drive was rotated using an electric drill. The magneto produced spark at all ignition leads. No damage was observed to the magneto housing, but both ignition harnesses sustained varying levels of impact damage in the form of cuts and abrasions to multiple leads. &#x0D;\nThe oil dipstick was found securely installed in the filler neck and indicated that 6 quarts of oil was contained in the engine oil sump. Oil was found draining from an area on the No. 3 cylinder exhaust tube that was impact damaged and due to the orientation of the airplane at the accident site. Oil was also found on the accessory section of the engine around the oil filter as the oil filter had sustained a high level of impact damage and was separated from oil filter’s threaded base. A portion of filter element was removed, examined, and found to be clean with no metallic particles or debris present. The oil suction screen plug was found to be tight, and safety wired to the oil sump. The screen was unobstructed and clear of any debris. &#x0D;\nThe fuel system including the engine driven fuel pump, fuel manifold, and fuel servo were all found attached to the engine at the time of the examination. The fuel pump’s 45-degree outlet fitting was found slightly loose with the mating hose tight to the fitting. No fuel staining was observed from the fitting or on the fuel pump housing itself. The fuel divider was tightly installed to the top of the engine with all injection lines tight and secure to each injection nozzle. The fuel injection manifold was disassembled with no debris or tears noted to its diaphragm. The fuel servo was attached to the lower side of the engine with all lines tight and secure, but all four hold down nuts were found loose when slight pressure with a wrench was applied. Torque stripes were present on the studs and nuts. The torque stripes did not appear to be disturbed or misaligned. The throttle plate was found in the closed position. When the throttle arm was actuated manually, the throttle plate moved freely within the servo, but the threaded rod for the idle thumb screw adjustment was found fractured and not connected. The fuel injection nozzles were found to be free and clear of any debris.&#x0D;\nThe vacuum pump was found securely installed to the accessory section of the engine. The rotor and vanes within were all found intact with no fractures or damage observed. The drive coupling was present with no damage observed and the entire unit spun freely when rotated by hand. &#x0D;\nThe propeller governor was found securely installed to the rear of the engine. Its screen was found free and clear of any debris and oil flowed from the unit when rotated by hand.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was retained for further examination.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot departed on a 1 hour flight. When the airplane was on final approach at the destination airport, the pilot added power because the airplane was losing altitude. However, the engine did not respond to the increase in throttle and continued to sink. The airplane landed just short of the runway, flipped over, and came to rest inverted which resulted in substantial damage.&#x0D;\nThe pilot turned the fuel selector valve to the off position immediately after the accident, so fuel selector position before the accident could not be confirmed. There was no fuel leaking out of the fuel tanks, and there was no fuel on the runway. Neither wing fuel tank was breached and when the wing tanks were drained following the accident, the right fuel tank had about 45 gallons of fuel and the left fuel tank was empty. According to the manufacturer’s pilot operating handbook (POH), each tank holds 46 gallons of fuel of which 44 gallons is usable fuel. &#x0D;\nThe fuel tanks, fuel system, and engine were examined after the accident and no mechanical failures or malfunctions were found that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\nBefore departing for the 1 hour flight, the airplane was fueled with 20 gallons of fuel (10 gallons per side). The pilot said that with the 20 added gallons of fuel, he estimated that the plane had about 70 gallons (35 gallons per side) when he departed. &#x0D;\nPerformance calculations revealed that total fuel consumed for the accident flight would have been between 9.3 to 13.4 gallons of fuel. If the airplane had 70 gallons of fuel when it departed, there should have been about 56 to 60 gallons of fuel remaining (28 to 30 gallons per side). &#x0D;\nBased on the left tank having no fuel in it after the accident and the right tank being full, it is likely that the pilot was operating on only the left fuel tank for several flights. When he departed on the accident flight, the left tank was filled with 10 gallons of fuel, which was about the amount the engine would have burned during the 1 hour flight..",
    "FactualNarrative": "On October 1, 2023, about 1302 central standard time, a Cessna 182R airplane, N357HT, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Olathe, Kansas. The pilot was not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot entered the traffic pattern at Johnson County Airport (OJC), Olathe, Kansas, checked that the mixture was full rich, and advanced the propeller to high rpm. When he turned onto final approach, he added engine power because he was too low; however, there was no engine response to his throttle input, and the airplane continued to descend. The airplane touched down just short of the runway, flipped over when the nosewheel contacted the approach end of the runway surface, and came to rest inverted. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the wings, vertical stabilizer, and engine mount.&#x0D;\nIn an initial phone interview with the pilot, he stated that he sumped the fuel tanks at Newton City Airport (EWK), Newton, Kansas before departing for OJC,  but did not check the amount of fuel in each tank. Later, when the pilot filled out the NTSB Form 6120.1, he stated that he had 70 gallons of fuel on board the airplane. He also said that prior to leaving EWK, he refueled with 20 gallons of fuel (10 gallons per side.) An email from the airport manager at EWK confirmed that the airplane was filled with 20 gallons of fuel (10 each side).&#x0D;\nDuring recovery, the fuel tanks were drained; the right tank had 45 gallons, and the left tank had none. There were no breaches in the fuel tanks or fuel leaking onto the runway. According to the airplane manufacturer’s pilot operating handbook, each fuel tank holds 46 gallons of fuel, and 44 gallons is usable fuel for a total of 88 gallons of useable fuel. The pilot stated that he turned the fuel selector valve to the off position after the accident, so fuel selector valve position before the accident could not be verified.&#x0D;\nAccording to ADS-B data, the flight from EWK to OJC was about 1 hour long. Performance charts from the Cessna 182R pilot operating handbook were utilized to determine fuel burn for the flight. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was completing a cross-country flight at night and had arrived in the area of the destination airport. After entering an extended downwind leg of the traffic pattern, he was flying over a lake when the accident occurred. The airplane entered a left base-to-final turn that developed into a steep, spiral dive to the right, and continued until the airplane impacted the lake. The airplane lacked an autopilot; therefore, it was being manually flown by the pilot. No preimpact malfunctions of the airplane were identified during a postaccident examination of the recovered wreckage. &#x0D;\nThe pilot was not instrument-rated and had no recent experience flying at night. Witnesses indicated visibility in the area was reduced by wildfire smoke. Surveillance video confirmed that the sky was obscured and that the airplane was flying through low clouds immediately before the loss of control occurred. Few ground lights or other visual references were available in the vicinity of the lake that could have helped the pilot maintain orientation or aid in recovery after he lost control of the airplane. Loss of outside visual references during a visual flight rules (VFR) flight creates a high risk of spatial disorientation and loss of control for pilots who are not instrument-rated and current/proficient. Several risk factors for spatial disorientation were present in this case: reduced visibility, manual control, and maneuvering flight. Therefore, the pilot likely experienced spatial disorientation followed by a loss of control in flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot was advised by a flight instructor before departing on the accident flight that meteorological information indicated visibility might be diminished by the time he arrived at the destination airport, but he decided to depart anyway. According to the instructor, who was a friend of the pilot, the pilot had experienced multiple delays returning the accident airplane to his home and had plans with a friend that evening. Thus, the pilot appears to have disregarded information that the flight might have been unsafe to operate under VFR, and he likely did not divert because he was motivated to avoid further delays and attend to a social obligation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\nOn September 30, 2023, about 1942 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 150, N6312G, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Gilford, New Hampshire. The private pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot departed in visual meteorological conditions from Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport (PVD) Providence, Rhode Island, about 1610 eastern daylight time, and was destined for the Laconia Municipal Airport (LCI), Laconia, New Hampshire. According to the pilot’s friend/flight instructor, the pilot had flown to PVD earlier in the month for a flight review, but due to weather, had not been able to return to New Hampshire after the review was completed. The purpose of the accident flight was to return the airplane back to his home in New Hampshire. The pilot planned to land at LCI and have dinner with his girlfriend, who was waiting for him at LCI when the accident occurred. ADS-B data revealed that the pilot entered a 45° entry (about mid-field) to the right downwind for runway 26 at LCI between 1,300 and 1,400 ft mean sea level (msl). A review of airport surveillance video revealed the runway lights were turned on when the airplane entered the traffic pattern. The airplane continued on the downwind and after passing abeam the threshold of runway 26, the airplane continued 1.6 miles on a course about 66 degrees true (80 degrees magnetic). The airplane then crossed the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee and continued on the same course for an additional 0.4 nm. The airplane’s position and altitude were uncertain for part of this time due to missing data points. However, the last three recorded data points showed the airplane beginning a left turn 0.4 miles beyond the shoreline of the lake at an altitude of 1,275 ft msl.&#x0D;\nA witness was sitting in his truck with the window open on the shore of the lake when he saw the “bright” landing lights of the airplane pass by him from left to right. The airplane was less than 100 ft above the water and was in a descending right turn. He said the airplane impacted the water at an angle and did not go straight in. The witness said the accident happened so fast that he did not recall if he heard the airplane’s engine or not. He said the wind was calm, and he did not observe any fog in the area. The moon was full, but the haze from wildfires diminished its illumination and it was dark over the lake.&#x0D;\nAnother witness was on the shore of the lake when he observed the airplane. He said he was looking out at the water when he heard the sound of the airplane’s engine to his left and looked up. The witness saw the airplane just above the tree line of Welch Island. The weather was a little “foggy” out, but he could see the airplane’s red/green position lights and its white landing lights. The airplane then suddenly went “full throttle” and “dove down” in a descending right turn. Seconds later, the airplane impacted the water. The witness reiterated that the airplane’s engine was “running fine” and going “full power” when it hit the water. &#x0D;\nVideo obtained from a surveillance camera about 1.3 nm southeast of the accident location revealed the airplane appeared to be in a shallow descent with its lights partially obscured by clouds. About 12 seconds later, the airplane emerged from the clouds in a steep, spiral dive and impacted the water.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was located the following morning about 3 miles east north-east of LCI in 57 ft of water.&#x0D;\nPILOT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe 70-year-old pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. He did not hold an instrument rating. His last FAA third-class medical was issued on May 2, 2023. Although his third-class medical was still valid at the time of the accident, the pilot had also applied for BasicMed and completed the BasicMed Course and Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist (CMEC) on May 2, 2023.&#x0D;\nA review of the pilot’s flight logbook revealed he had logged numerous flights in and out of LCI. His last flight review was on September 9, 2023, which was the last entry before the accident. At that time, he had logged a total of 674.8 flight hours. Additional review of the logbook, which went back to December 2020, revealed there were no logged flights at night, nor was there any simulated or actual instrument flight time logged. &#x0D;\nAIRPLANE INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe single-engine, two-seat accident airplane was not equipped with an autopilot. The airframe maintenance logbook was found in the airplane; however, the engine and propeller maintenance logs were not located. A review of the airplane logbook revealed that the airplane’s last annual inspection was completed on March 12, 2023, at a tachometer time of 2,599.6 hours.&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe weather conditions at LCI at 1956 were reported as wind calm, visibility 5 statute miles in haze, clear skies, temperature 14 degrees C, (dewpoint not reported), and a barometric altimeter setting of 30.19 inHg.&#x0D;\nThe sunset occurred about 1829, about 73 minutes before the accident. Smoke from wildfires resulted in the sky being obscured haze on the evening of the accident, reducing the full moon’s illumination. An eyewitness described the conditions as “dark” and “hazy” due to wildfire smoke. Surveillance video of the accident indicated that the sky was overcast, as there were no visible sources of lunar illumination or cultural lighting along the shoreline of the lake. &#x0D;\nWRECKAGE INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe airplane wreckage was recovered from the water and examined. All major components of the airplane were recovered and there was no evidence of any preimpact fire or impact with birds. Both wings and the tail control surfaces sustained extensive impact damage. Flight control continuity was established for all major flight control surfaces to the cockpit. The flap actuator was in the fully retracted position. The elevator trim tab was not recovered, but the trim tab actuator remained attached to the right horizontal stabilizer. The rod end of the actuator had been pulled out from impact forces and no measurement could be obtained. &#x0D;\nThe cockpit area sustained extensive impact damage. The throttle/mixture/carburetor heat controls were all full forward. &#x0D;\nThe engine and its two-blade propeller sustained impact damage. Both blades were bent aft mid-span and exhibited some twisting. The engine’s crankshaft was manually rotated via the propeller. When rotated, compression and valvetrain continuity were confirmed on each cylinder. The top spark plugs were removed, and the electrodes were covered in mud, but appeared to be in good condition. Both magnetos remained attached to the engine and several tears were noted to the ignition harness. The magnetos were removed and both couplings snapped when rotated. Spark could not be obtained to the ignition leads due to water damage. &#x0D;\nThe vacuum pump also separated from the engine and sustained impact damage. The pump was disassembled, and the rotors were heavily fractured. All but one of the vanes was intact. Rotational scoring was observed 360°around the interior wall of the pump.&#x0D;\nNo evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures were identified that would have precluded normal operation of the engine or airplane at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe State of New Hampshire Office of the Chief Medical Examiner performed an autopsy on the pilot. The cause of death was determined to be “multiple blunt injuries.” &#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for drugs.&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe pilot did not hold an instrument rating and had no recent experience operating at night or in instrument meteorological conditions. According to the pilot’s friend and flight instructor, who had recently provided the pilot’s flight review, he said he discouraged the pilot from making the flight to LCI because the temperature-dewpoint spread was forecast to converge that evening. &#x0D;\nThe friend reported that the pilot had experienced previous weather-related delays and insisted on flying to New Hampshire that night. The pilot’s girlfriend was supposed to pick him up after he landed at LCI. After the accident, the pilot’s friend learned from the pilot’s girlfriend that they had plans for a “special dinner,” though he did not know what occasion they were celebrating. &#x0D;\nThe pilot’s friend said he sent a text message to the pilot about 1849 to ask how the flight was going and the pilot replied by sending him a photo of the instrument panel of his airplane. This photo showed his iPad fastened to the yoke and presenting a primary flight display as well as a navigation display with a VFR sectional chart overlay. The cockpit was illuminated by a red overhead light and traditional “round dial” flight instruments were visible behind the iPad. A lower portion of the windscreen was included in the photo, but no horizon or ground lights could be seen. The pilot’s friend sent several additional text messages between 1916 and 1917 warning the pilot that instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) were present at LCI and urging him to divert to another airport. The pilot did not respond. The pilot’s friend said he believed the pilot’s decision making was degraded by “get-there-itis.” The friend was watching the flight via FlightAware and observed the airplane enter the traffic pattern, turn downwind, and then continue out over the lake. He said the pilot could have turned sooner on to the base leg, and he was not sure why the pilot extended the downwind over the lake.&#x0D;\nVarious factors have been implicated in pilots’ improper decisions to continue VFR flight into IMC conditions. Shortcomings in a pilot’s in-flight decision making may occur in the situation assessment or action selection stage. Errors in the situation selection may stem from an inability to accurately assess the weather conditions. Errors in the action selection stage could stem from a flawed mental risk assessment. Risk assessment can be influenced by motivational factors. For example, pilots are more likely to press on in deteriorating conditions if they have already invested a significant amount of time in a flight, likely to avoid the inconvenience of diverting or returning to their airport of origin. Social pressure is another motivational factor that can create motivational conflicts between social obligations and the desire to maintain an adequate safety margin.  This could contribute to plan continuation bias, a reluctance to delay or divert a flight, despite evidence that it is no longer safe to continue the flight as planned. Loss of outside visual references during VFR flight poses a high risk of spatial disorientation and loss of control for pilots who are not instrument trained, and the risk of such accidents is also higher at night. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On September 30, 2023, about 1510 eastern daylight time, a Cessna 182Q, N747UC, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Towanda, Pennsylvania. The private pilot was not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he performed a preflight inspection of the airplane in its hangar, which included checking oil and fuel quantity (55 gallons), and sampling fuel from the fuel tanks with no anomalies noted. The engine started normally and the engine run-up was normal. During initial climb from runway 23, about 300 ft above ground level, the engine began to run rough. The pilot varied the throttle, mixture, and carburetor heat levers in an attempt to restore power; however, the engine subsequently lost all power. The propeller continued to rotate and did not stop completely. The pilot moved the fuel selector from both, to left, to right, back to both, but was unable to restore engine power. He then performed a forced landing to a field. During the landing, the airplane nosed over, coming to rest inverted. The pilot then turned the fuel selector, magneto key, and master switch to the off position before exiting the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to both wings and the vertical stabilizer. The wreckage was further examined following its recovery to a salvage facility. Before transport, about 20 or more gallons were defueled from each wing (about 40 gallons or more total). The fuel was blue, clear, and absent of any visible contamination. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the postaccident engine examination, the valve covers and the top spark plugs were removed.  The spark plug electrodes were intact and gray in color. The propeller was rotated 360° by hand to confirm crankshaft, camshaft, and valvetrain continuity to the rear accessory section of the engine. The single-drive, dual magneto impulse coupling emitted activation noise during the propeller rotation. Thumb compression was also attained on all six cylinders. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor remained intact and continuity of its linkage was confirmed. The carburetor was then removed and disassembled and fuel was noted throughout the carburetor and fuel lines. The fuel was blue, clear, and absent of any visible contamination. The carburetor accelerator pump jet emitted a fuel stream when the throttle was actuated by hand. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe air intake and engine exhaust were free from obstructions. Lastly, a magneto timing test was performed, which revealed that the timing was correct.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of a carburetor icing chart revealed that the airplane was not susceptible to carburetor icing at cruise power for the prevailing temperature and dew point. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "United Airlines flight 329 conducted a rejected takeoff after experiencing abnormal acceleration while on Runway 16R at Denver International Airport (DEN), Denver, Colorado. The flight was a regularly scheduled passenger flight to Boston Logan International Airport (BOS), Boston, Massachusetts. As a result of a subsequent brake fire following the rejected take off, the aircraft suffered substantial damage. No injuries were reported.&#x0D;\nThe flight crew reported that before the flight, the captain and the first officer (FO) met to review the flight plan, maintenance documents, weather, and Notice to Airmen (NOTAMS). It was then that the captain noticed that the airplane had just come out of maintenance. The flight crew reported that the airplane would be close to maximum takeoff weight, and that the temperature would be high, and the flight would be taking off on runway 16R. Airport operations made runway 16R the designated runway for departures that day since it is the longest runway at DEN, with a length of 16,000 feet.&#x0D;\nOnce the flight crew were onboard the airplane they reviewed the takeoff performance data where they noticed that the planned takeoff weight was more than what would be allowed for a takeoff from runway 16R. The weight at the gate was 172,800 lbs. but needed to be below 171,700 lbs. for a safe takeoff, taking into consideration the atmospheric conditions at the time. The captain reported making a call to dispatch where he spoke with a different dispatcher than the one who had created the original flight plan. The original flight plan had been created using a lower temperature of 29 Celsius which had been correct at the time, but the temperature had since risen to 31 Celsius. &#x0D;\nThe new dispatcher sent 3 flight plan revisions. The flight crew reported that the first revision removed 1,000 lbs. of cargo, but did not remove enough weight to be within limits, and a second flight plan revision was requested. The second revision removed another 1000 lbs. by removing 8 passengers. The flight crew mentioned to dispatch that there was about 1000 lbs. of extra fuel onboard that could be burned off with an extended taxi, and dispatch sent a new revision to the flight plan that required an extended taxi to burn off the 1,000 lbs. of excess fuel to reduce the takeoff weight instead of removing passengers.&#x0D;\nThe flight crew reported experiencing a normal pushback before preforming a “long slow” taxi to the runway with the power elevated while applying additional braking to burn more fuel. &#x0D;\nOnce reaching the runway, the flight held there for an additional 10 to 15 minutes with the parking brake set to burn the additional fuel. The pilots reported that they never had any indication that the brakes were getting hot, and the Boeing 737 has no brake temperature monitoring system to inform the flight crew of brake temperatures. The flight crew commented that every other Boeing aircraft they have flown had a brake temperature monitoring system. &#x0D;\nOnce below the required weight requirement, the flight crew notified Air Traffic Control (ATC) and were subsequently cleared for takeoff. &#x0D;\nThe captain was the pilot flying and reported quickly noticing the aircraft not accelerating normally during the takeoff roll. He immediately rejected the takeoff and the FO informed tower. The tower then observed and notified the flight crew that there was smoke and fire on the right side of the airplane. The flight crew had no indication of fire in the cockpit. The captain then requested Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) and declared an emergency with ATC. &#x0D;\nARFF fought the fire by releasing fire retardant on both main gear while the FO ran through the rejected takeoff checklist. &#x0D;\nThe captain coordinated with the flight attendants to ensure the safety of all passengers. The captain reported making multiple public announcements (PA) to the passengers to inform them of the situation. &#x0D;\nAfter all appropriate checklists were complete, the captain decided against immediate evacuation based on communications with ARFF and the passengers disembarked via the air stairs that were provided by airport operations. The passengers were then driven back to the passenger terminal in buses.&#x0D;\nPostaccident investigation of the airplane revealed that the No. 1 and 2 tires had deflated. Number 3 and 4 tires had separated from the wheel assembly and there was evidence that tire fragments had impacted the airframe in several areas. The number 3 wheel assembly scraped the runway and had ground down with about 1/3 of the assembly missing, the number 4 wheel assembly was ground down to about half, and the number 2 engine nacelle had scraped the runway. In addition, several panels of the wing to body (WTB) fairing panels had suffered heat damage and tire debris was imbedded in the inner face of the engine inlet inner barrel acoustic panel. The right horizontal stabilizer also received structural damage.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On September 29, 2023, at approximately 1200 Eastern Daylight Time, an experimental amateur-built Smith Cozy Mark IV, N95SF, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Cullman, Alabama. The airline transport pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness, he had spoken to the pilot earlier on the day of the accident. The pilot had indicated that he had just changed the propeller governor and was planning to fly over to the witness's field. The witness mentioned that the pilot often flew by just to say hello. While the witness was working outside, he heard the airplane approaching and looked up to watch the pilot fly over. He observed the airplane coming from the east, making a northward turn, and then turning south for a low pass. The pilot acknowledged him with a wave before initiating a climbing left turn. During this turn, he noticed an unusual \"wiggle\" in the rear of the airplane, accompanied by a strange noise from the propeller that he described as a droning sound with fluctuating pitch. Subsequently, the airplane “stalled” and impacted in a level attitude in the field.&#x0D;\nAn examination of the airframe revealed that all flight control surfaces were still attached to the airframe. Flight control cable continuity was confirmed from the flight controls in the cockpit to the flight control surfaces. An inspection of the throttle and mixture control cables revealed that they were still connected to the engine controls. The propeller control lever in the cockpit was also still connected to the propeller governor, and continuity of the cable was established. Examination of the airframe showed that the fiberglass hull of the airplane was cracked. Both wing assemblies were broken and displaced aft at the wing roots. The engine remained in the cowling but had become detached from the engine mount. All four mounting bolts and nuts remained in place on the engine mount. Further examination revealed that the upper engine mount washers were missing, and the rubber bushings remained. Two thin washers were found on the bottom of the cowling, displaying hex-shaped holes where the nuts had extruded through.&#x0D;\nAn examination of the engine revealed valvetrain continuity throughout the engine. Suction and compression were obtained while turning the crankshaft 360°. Examination of the propeller governor showed that the gear rotated when turned, and the screen was free of debris. The ignition system was intact, and upon removal of the spark plugs, they appeared gray in color, indicating normal operation. A borescope inspection of the engine cylinders did not reveal any anomalies.",

The rear-seat rudder/brake pedals were found in the forward adjustment position. With full left rudder deflection, the left brake pedal’s range was restricted by the upper spray valve control pushrod. There were no other mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nThe design of the spray valve control lever and left rear rudder pedal in the forward adjustment position restricted the left rudder and brake pedal, which resulted in a loss of control during landing.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On September 28, 2023, about 1130 central daylight time, an Air Tractor AT-802 airplane, N445HA, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at Herington Regional Airport (HRU), Herington, Kansas. The flight instructor and pilot receiving instruction were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor, who was in the rear seat, stated that during landing as they slowed to 35 to 40 mph, the tailwheel unlocked, and the airplane turned right. The flight instructor applied full left rudder and attempted to apply the left toe brake, but the brake pedal was restricted from moving forward. When left rudder and left brake were applied, the top of the pedal contacted the spray control lever pushrod and full brake could not be applied. The airplane continued off the right side of the runway. The airplane impacted a ditch, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed that the front-seat rudder/brake pedals could move through their full range of motion without interference. The rear-seat rudder/brake pedals were found in the forward adjustment position. With the rear pedals in the forward position, the left rear brake pedal range was restricted by the upper spray valve control pushrod, preventing the application of full left brake from the rear seat. There were no other mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\nThe upper spray valve push rod was installed in the airframe by Air Tractor during the original production of the airplane. Air Tractor reported that there were 94 other airplanes affected by this design installation. &#x0D;\nAs result of this investigation, on December 29, 2023, Air Tractor completed service letter (SL) 405, which was applicable to certain AT-802 airplanes with a spray valve control lever installed. The SL was issued due to the spray valve control valve pushrod’s interference with the left rear rudder pedal, which reduced controllability and could lead to an accident. The interference was only possible when the left rear rudder pedal is in the forward adjustment position (Figure 1). This interference prevents simultaneous application of full left rudder and left brake when operated from the rear seat. This control restriction could lead to a loss of control causing significant injury and aircraft damage. Placement of the rear rudder pedals in the rear adjustment position is a temporary solution that will allow full, simultaneous application of left rudder and left brake.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Air Tractor photo and labels of the rudder pedal restriction with spray valve control lever pushrod (Courtesy of Air Tractor SL 405). &#x0D;\nAs result of this investigation, on April 25, 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration issued special airworthiness information bulletin (SAIB) 2024-03, “Rudder Control System,” which recommended that all affected operators modify the rear cockpit rudder pedal adjustment in accordance with Air Tractor, Inc.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "American Airlines flight 160 encountered turbulence during climb to cruise while enroute to Athens International Airport (ATH), Spata, Greece from O’Hare International Airport (ORD), Chicago, Illinois resulting in a flight attendant (FA) being seriously injured.&#x0D;\nThe captain reported having completed a briefing with the cabin crew prior to the flight where he discussed turbulence precautions and pointed out areas specifically where they expected the flight would encounter turbulence. &#x0D;\nDuring climb to the cruise altitude of flight level (FL) 370 [37,000 feet], the flight crew reported that air traffic control (ATC) assigned an intermediate level off at FL 330. The captain and first officer stated that while at FL 330 they discussed the continual light chop that the flight was experiencing and decided to keep the fasten seat belt sign on. &#x0D;\nThe flight was then cleared to climb to FL 350 and the crew stated that during the climb the ride was smooth. Soon after reaching FL 350, the flight crew reported answering a cabin call informing them that a service cart had injured a flight attendant (FA2). The flight crew then informed flight dispatch and diverted to Philadelphia International Airport (PHL), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they made an overweight landing and were met by paramedics at the gate.&#x0D;\nThe cabin crew reported that FA2 was standing in the back galley preparing the flight meals when the pilot announced on the public address (PA) system that they were going to experience some turbulence. When the turbulence was encountered, the flight had started to climb, and FA2 reported that in a matter of seconds she was pinned between the cart and the back galley wall. She added that the cart then began to fall, knocking her to the floor. She said the cart fell on her before she could get up and the back of her right ankle was impacted, causing a large tear in the skin and subsequent bleeding. An onboard passenger who was an acute care registered nurse practitioner assisted FA2. &#x0D;\nUpon landing, FA2 was removed from the aircraft on a stretcher and taken to a hospital where she was diagnosed with an Achilles tendon injury, as well as other injuries. &#x0D;\nThe cabin crew stated that the cart’s brakes had been applied but thought it had malfunctioned causing the food cart to move and injure FA2. According to American Airlines, the vendor who maintains and repairs the carts was unable to identify the event cart nor locate its maintenance and repair history.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On September 27, 2023, about 2249 central daylight time, a Piper PA-28-161, N3079M, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Whitesville, Kentucky. The flight instructor and student pilot were fatally injured. The airplane was operated by Eagle Flight Academy as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator and the student pilot’s regular flight instructor, the accident instructor and student pilot were on the return portion of a night cross-country flight, and it was their first time flying together. Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated that the airplane departed Bowling Green-Woodhurst Airport (BWG), Bowling Green, Kentucky, around 2155. The airplane climbed to 4,500 ft msl and proceeded on a northwesterly course toward Owensboro/Daviess County Regional Airport (OWB), Owensboro, Kentucky, on a visual flight rules flight plan.&#x0D;\nA post to the flight instructor’s social media account at 2215 (about 34 minutes before the accident) depicted an annotated image from a mobile-device-based aviation navigation tool. The image depicted the airplane’s current position northwest of Bowling Green, Kentucky, along with the planned route of flight to OWB. Weather radar imagery was also displayed in the image, which had been annotated with a circle around the flight track and nearby weather radar returns. Figure 1 shows an excerpted screen capture from the flight instructor’s social media post. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - Screen capture of a post to the flight instructor’s social media account. Note the airplane’s current position (blue airplane icon), the planned route of flight (magenta line), the depicted weather radar imagery, and entire area circled in red.&#x0D;\nAccording to preliminary air traffic control (ATC) voice communications, the pilot contacted ATC at 2244 and the controller advised the pilot of heavy to extreme precipitation at the airplane’s nine o’clock position. ADS-B data showed that the airplane continued its northwesterly course and about two minutes later, the flight instructor requested an instrument flight rules (IFR) clearance. The controller issued the clearance and provided an easterly vector to assist the flight in getting out of the weather. The flight instructor stated to the controller that the airplane was “getting blown around like crazy,” and the airplane’s flight track showed a turn to the northwest followed by a right circling turn. The controller reiterated the heading of 090º, and the flight instructor responded that they were in “pretty extreme turbulence.” The flight track showed a continuing right descending turn, and no further communications were received from the flight instructor. The airplane's last ADS-B position, at 2249, was at an altitude of 2,200 ft and about 1,000 ft northwest of the wreckage debris field, which spanned 25 acres in a hilly, densely wooded area. &#x0D;\nAll major components of the airplane, except for the left portion of the stabilator, were located in the debris field. The fuselage was separated aft of the rear seat, and the forward fuselage, including the cockpit, engine, and right wing, were located together in the most westerly portion of the debris field. The left wing, with aileron attached, was separated from the fuselage, and was located about 800 ft east of the forward fuselage. The flap was separated from the wing and located in the debris field. The right wing remained attached to the forward fuselage and was upside down with aileron and flap attached. The empennage with vertical stabilizer intact was located over a ridge about 200 ft north of the forward fuselage. The rudder was torn diagonally from top to bottom, with the lower portion remaining attached to the vertical stabilizer and the upper portion separated and located near the empennage in the debris field. The stabilator was torn chordwise just outboard of the hinges. The right side of the stabilator was located about 1,500 ft away from the forward fuselage in the most eastern edge of the debris field.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a salvage facility for further examination. The left wing’s interior ribs exhibited signatures consistent with the aileron bellcrank having been pulled from its mount and drawn through the wing to the inboard end. The aileron bellcrank was broken with the balance cable arm remaining attached to the balance cable. The balance cable was continuous to the right wing. The remainder of the bellcrank was not located. The right wing aileron cables remained attached to the bellcrank and the bellcrank remained attached to the wing. &#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that the fixed-pitch propeller remained attached to the crankshaft propeller flange, and both propeller blades appeared straight. The engine displayed impact damage. The starter ring gear was impact fractured into several pieces, and the alternator was attached to the front of the engine by one bolt. The carburetor was impact separated at the bowl. Suction and compression were observed on all cylinders when the propellor was rotated by hand. Valvetrain continuity was confirmed throughout the engine and all rocker arms moved when the crankshaft was rotated. No anomalies were noted during examination of the engine cylinders with a lighted borescope. Both magnetos were tightly installed, and once removed and rotated using an electric drill, spark was produced at each ignition lead point. Liquid consistent in odor and color with 100LL aviation fuel drained from the boost pump when the filter cover was removed. Examination of the engine did not reveal any preaccident anomalies or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "JetBlue Airlines flight 1256 encountered convective turbulence while in cruise at 34,000 ft over the Caribbean Sea approximately 200 nautical miles (nm) south of Negril, Jamaica. As a result of the turbulence, three flight attendants received minor injuries, two passengers received minor injuries, and four passengers received serious injuries. The aircraft continued to Fort Lauderdale International Airport (FLL), Florida without further incident.&#x0D;\nAccording to the Captain, the takeoff climb, and initial cruise at 34,000 ft progressed normally, and the flight conditions were dark, clear with no convective activity observed.  The flight crew stated they had the aircraft radar on, had Wi-Fi connectivity, and were continually updating radar images on their Jeppeson FliteDeck (JeppFD) and Weather Services International (WSI) iPad applications. The first officer stated there was significant precipitation and storms to the north of their location in the area near Cuba.  As the flight proceeded north, the crew noted an additional area of weather between Jamaica and Cuba that required weather deviations.  The first officer stated that he and the captain changed weather ranges on their radar displays multiple times to maintain their situational awareness of the precipitation.  &#x0D;\nAt 0335:47 local time, flight data recorder (FDR) data indicated the weather radar was engaged in “weather and turbulence mode” on both the captains and first officer navigational display, with the captain’s range set at 160 nm and the first officer’s set at 320 nm.  According to the Airbus Flight Crew Operations Manual (FCOM), when engaged in “weather and turbulence mode”, the navigation display will indicate turbulence and precipitation areas.  Autopilot number 2 and the auto thrust were engaged, with Mach target of 0.8 selected, and the seatbelt sign was illuminated.   &#x0D;\nAt 0336:20 the airplane encountered turbulence. The flight crew stated they entered severe turbulence and extreme precipitation without warning, with no returns on their weather radar.  The FDR data indicated that the airplane varied in pitch angle between -1.8° and +6.3°, the roll angle varied from -8.4° left wing down to 8.8° right wing down, and the vertical acceleration varied between -0.69G and +1.68G.  During the encounter, the airplane climbed from 33,980 ft to 34,790 ft, and the Mach varied between 0.732 and 0.820.  During this time, the computed longitudinal wind recorded on the FDR varied between 13 knots headwind and 39 knots tailwind, and the computed crosswind varied from 31 knots right crosswind and 24 knots left crosswind.   At 0337:08, with the airplane at 34,776 ft altitude, the autopilot was disengaged and a nose down input was applied on the captain’s controller.  By 0337:40, the airplane had exited the turbulence, the autopilot was reengaged, and the airplane began to descend back to its assigned attitude of 34,000 ft.  &#x0D;\nThe flight crew stated that before the encounter there were no returns on the airplane weather radar, they did not see the cloud ahead, there was no visible lightning, and the weather was not depicted on any weather applications on their iPads. The flight crew stated the only radar returns that were displayed were north of their location near Cuba.  Once clear of the weather the crew proceeded to FLL.  FDR data showed the flight landed at 0518:27. Once on the ground, the flight crew entered “weather radar inoperative and severe turbulence encounter” in the maintenance logbook.  &#x0D;\nA post accident review of meteorology data showed that there were no Significant Meteorological Information (SIGMET) advisories issued by a Meteorological Watch Office that were active for the accident location at the accident time.  A review of the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) lightning database revealed no flash total lightning activity in the 10 minutes preceding and 4 minutes following the turbulence encounter within 20 miles of the accident location.  A Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) model sounding for near the accident site at 0500 was retrieved from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Air Resources Laboratory and analyzed by the Rawinsonde Observation (RAOB) program. The model showed wind near 35,000 ft was from the south at about 15 knots. RAOB did not identify any moderate or greater clear air turbulence in the atmosphere.  &#x0D;\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 infrared (10.3µm) data were obtained from an archive at the Space Science Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Images from these data at 0340 are presented in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 presents a regional view of cloud coverage. The accident location is coincident with a cloud pattern consistent with convective activity. Figure 2 presents a closer view of the accident location. An approximately 2-minute portion of the accident aircraft’s flight path (south-to-north) across the cloud pattern consistent with convective activity reveals that the accident aircraft flew across the coldest portion of the cloud, which was at a brightness temperature of -55°C. According to the GDAS sounding, this temperature corresponded to a cloud top height of about 42,000 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. GOES-16 infrared imagery from 0340. Image is not corrected for parallax error. The accident location is denoted by the red dot inside the red circle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. GOES-16 infrared imagery from 0340. Image is not corrected for parallax error. An approximately 2-minute portion of the accident aircraft’s flight path (south-to-north) is depicted by the light blue line.&#x0D;\nAfter being logged as inoperative by the flight crew, the weather radar unit was initially electrically tested on the airplane with no electrical shorts detected.  The weather radar was then removed from the event airplane and sent to the manufacturer for testing.  The manufacturer testing found that the unit passed all test requirements.",

    "FactualNarrative": "On September 23, 2023, about 1914 central daylight time, a Beech C23 airplane, N18994, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Gonzales, Texas. The pilot received minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, he intended to complete a personal flight to Roger M Dreyer Memorial Airport (T20), Gonzales, Texas. During the final approach to runway 15 he experienced wind shear and elected to go around. He applied full throttle and began to climb out when the engine sustained a loss of power, so he made a forced landing to a field off the left side of the runway. The airplane collided with a fence and a tree, which separated the right wing near the wing root. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the wings and fuselage. The undamaged exhaust system was examined using a flashlight in the tailpipe and a lighted borescope, which revealed a blockage in the tailpipe; the muffler was then removed and cut open. The flame tube was blocking at least 95% of the tailpipe exit path; the piece was lodged in the tailpipe. The fracture area appeared degraded and covered in corrosion. A 3-inch crack was noted on the muffler endcap opposite of the separated flame tube. There were no other mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane maintenance logbooks revealed that, during a maintenance inspection on December 24, 1997 (3,523.42 hours total time and 1,260.42 hours since major overhaul), the exhaust system was inspected “for leaks and cracks. System found to be satisfactory.” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn January 2, 1999 (3,556.5 hours total time and 1,293.50 hours since major overhaul), another maintenance inspection was conducted by the same mechanic and there was no mention of the exhaust system. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 21, 2000, the airplane’s muffler was repaired and inspected by a separate exhaust system repair station. The work order for this muffler repair revealed that the muffler was to be inspected and repaired. The items replaced included: 3 tabs, the outer shell, 2 caps, 2 flame tubes, 2 elbows, 2 beaded ends, 2 end plates, and the tailpipe. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn April 1, 2000 (3,603.36 hours total time and 1,340.36 hours since major overhaul), another maintenance inspection was conducted by the same mechanic from 1997 and 1999, when they reinstalled the repaired muffler.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no additional maintenance logbook entries found specifically related to a muffler repair or replacement.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe most recent 100-hour/annual inspection was completed on November 23, 2022, (4,052.8 hours total time and 1,789.8 hours since major overhaul), during which 8 exhaust clamps were replaced and a new exhaust stud was installed on the No. 4 cylinder.  There was no specific mention of the muffler; however, 14 CFR Part 43 Appendix D—Scope and Detail of Items (as Applicable to the Particular Aircraft) To Be Included in Annual and 100-Hour Inspections, states in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(d) Each person performing an annual or 100-hour inspection shall inspect (where applicable) components of the engine and nacelle group as follows:&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n(8) Exhaust stacks—for cracks, defects, and improper attachment.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe installed Dynon Avionics revealed that the airplane total time was 4,108.2 hours at the time of the accident. Therefore, the muffler had been installed on the airplane for 504.84 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBeech maintenance and overhaul documents revealed that the exhaust system should be overhauled or replaced every 800 hours or when the condition warrants replacement. The exhaust muffler and shroud should be inspected every 100 hours. The documentation states, “It is recommended that at each 100 hour and/or annual inspection, all exhaust muffler shrouds be removed and the muffler thoroughly inspected for cracks, leaks and (if applicable) deterioration of the internal tubes which could cause a decrease in engine power due to blockage of the exhaust.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) FAA-H-8083-32B, Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook – Powerplant:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInternal Muffler Failures&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInternal failures (baffles, diffusers, etc.) can cause partial or complete engine power loss by restricting the flow of the exhaust gases. If pieces of the internal baffling breaks loose and partially or totally blocks the flow of exhaust gases, engine failure can occur. As opposed to other failures, erosion and carburization caused by the extreme thermal conditions are the primary causes of internal failures. Engine backfiring and combustion of unburned fuel within the exhaust system are probable contributing factors. In addition, local hot-spot areas caused by uneven exhaust gas flow can result in burning, bulging, or rupture of the outer muffler wall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExhaust System Repairs&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is generally recommended that exhaust stacks, mufflers, tailpipes, etc., be replaced with new or reconditioned components rather than repaired. Welded repairs to exhaust systems are complicated by the difficulty of accurately identifying the base metal so that the proper repair materials can be selected. Changes in composition and grain structure of the original base metal further complicate the repair. However, when welded repairs are necessary, the original contours should be retained; the exhaust system alignment must not be warped or otherwise affected. Repairs or sloppy weld beads that protrude internally are not acceptable as they cause local hot spots and may restrict exhaust gas flow.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular (AC) 91-59A, \"Inspection and Care of General Aviation Aircraft Exhaust Systems,\" emphasizes \"the safety hazards of poorly maintained aircraft exhaust systems (reciprocating powerplants) and highlights points at which exhaust system failures occur. Further, it provides information on the kinds of problems to be expected and recommends pilots perform ongoing preventive maintenance and mechanics perform maintenance.\" The AC also notes that potential failures can include partial or full engine power loss caused by loose baffles, cones, or diffusers on mufflers and heat exchangers that partially or completely block the exhaust gas outlet flow. -",

About six weeks prior to the accident flight, the airplane experienced a loss of engine power. &#x0D;\nThe accident flight was a cross country flight to provide the pilot/airplane owner with training required by the pilot’s insurance carrier. During the accident flight, the airplane operated normally during the first two hours of the flight but was then followed by a fuel flow/consumption rate that seemed a little high to the flight instructor. When the instructor tried to reduce the mixture setting, the engine began to run rough, which he thought was unusual. The engine began to run rough again, and the instructor increased the mixture setting, which smoothed the engine. The engine then ran rough two additional times, and both times, the instructor increased the mixture setting causing the engine roughness to cease. The engine roughness occurred again but was worse than roughness previously experienced. The instructor increased the mixture control to its full forward position and decided to divert to an alternate airport. The engine lost power during the approach to the alternate airport, and the flight instructor performed a forced landing to a field. During the landing, the airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and wings.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was retained for further examination.",

Three electric landing gear extension and retraction tests and the manual emergency landing gear extension procedure were completed with no anomalies noted. The airplane’s landing gear are hydraulically operated by an electrically powered reversible pump.&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with a Garmin G3X flight display that recorded several aircraft parameters, including electrical amperage (amps). The accident flight data was extracted by a mechanic and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge. A review of the data showed a sharp increase or spike in amps during the accident flight phases that were consistent with the landing gear retraction and extension. Another sharp increase in amps was noted after touchdown and during the landing roll at about 60 knots groundspeed. The reason for the sharp increase in amps during the landing roll could not be determined. -",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On September 21, 2023, about 1436 eastern daylight time, an Embraer SA EMB-525, N434FX, operated by Flexjet LLC, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near St. Simons Island, Georgia. The pilot, copilot and six passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91K fractional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight departed Westchester County Airport (HPN), White Plains, New York at 1239, destined for St. Simons Island Airport (SSI), St. Simons Island, Georgia.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, the departure and en route phases of the flight were uneventful. During the arrival phase into SSI they elected to fly the RNAV (GPS) Runway 4 approach to allow them to be better aligned and setup for the landing. Checklists and callouts were conducted, and the approach was stable. After the 500 ft stable callout was made the airplane crossed over a small section of trees and rose slightly. The airplane then began to porpoise slightly when it was about 100 to 150 ft above mean sea level. The pilot tried to make corrections, but the airplane was not responding to his control inputs. The airplane then landed hard and slid along the runway, coming to rest in the grass off of runway 4. After the airplane came to rest, they evacuated the passengers safely and powered down the airplane.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the copilot, the flight from HPN to SSI was uneventful until the final few seconds. When they were cleared for the approach, the pilot configured the airplane, slowed appropriately, and selected “Flaps 3” for the landing. The checklists were completed, and they had the runway in sight when they were 10 miles from the airport. No other traffic was identified as being in the airport traffic pattern and they prepared to land.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe copilot made the “500’, Stabilized, 20 knot of headwind” callout at approximately 500 ft’.  As the airplane crossed above the airport property, it began to pitch rapidly up and down.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe copilot then looked over at the pilot’s hand on the control side sick and he could see him moving it back and forth excessively. He then said something along the lines of “Take it easy there,” and the pilot replied that the airplane was not responding. At that point the airplane was “maybe 50 ft” above the runway. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane touched down hard, prior to the runway threshold, on centerline, bounced and then touched down again. The airplane was listing to the right and skidding on the runway while slowly drifting to the right. The airplane slid off the runway and onto the grass where it hit a concrete sign base before it came to rest on the grass.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior to opening the main cabin door, the copilot realized that both engines were still running. He then asked the pilot to shut down engines so that he could open the door to deplane the passengers. The copilot observed fuel gushing from the belly of the airplane when he exited.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site and airplane revealed that the airplane was substantially damaged. Both main landing gear were damaged, and the struts had punctured the top of the wings. During the impact sequence the airplane skidded down runway 4 for approximately 2,531 ft, then departed the right side of the runway, shearing off eight runway lights, one taxiway light, and destroying the taxiway A4 directional sign. The right main landing gear separated from the airplane and the leading edge of the right wing was damaged consistent with the impact with the taxiway sign. The airplane then went across taxiway A4, coming to rest between runway 4, taxiway A, and taxiway A4. The total distance from the airplane’s touchdown to where the airplane came to rest was approximately 3,083 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe reported wind at SSI about the time of the accident was from 050° at 13 knots, gusting to 23 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and pilot records, the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate, with a rating for airplane multiengine land, and commercial privileges for airplane single engine land and single engine sea. He also held type ratings on the BE-300, BE-400, CE-560XL, CE-650, CL-600, EMB-550, HS-125, and MU-300. His most recent FAA first-class medical certificate was issued on June 13, 2023.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was in the process of taking off when the left main gear spring assembly fractured. The airplane veered off the runway and ground contact substantially damaged the left horizontal stabilizer and elevator. &#x0D;\nMetallurgical examination of the failed gear spring assembly revealed it failed due to fatigue cracking and overload stresses. Further examination revealed corrosion underneath the primer paint and inside the dimples of the shot-peened area, which likely initiated the development of the fatigue crack. &#x0D;\nA records review revealed that in March of 2010, the left and right main gear spring assemblies were inspected, heat treated, shot peened and painted with a zinc-rich primer. It is likely that corrosion existed on the landing gear before the application of the primer paint, and that the inadequate removal of the corrosion allowed fatigue cracking to propagate until the left assembly failed in overstress.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On September 20, 2023, about 1445 mountain daylight time, a Cessna U206, N3923G, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Challis, Idaho. The pilot and three passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand air taxi flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he had picked up the passengers and taxied for departure. During the takeoff roll, the left main gear spring assembly separated from the underside of the fuselage. The airplane then veered left off the runway. Contact with the terrain substantially damaged the left elevator and horizontal stabilizer. Figure 1 is an image of the fractured left main gear spring assembly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. The two fractured sections of the Left main gear spring assembly.&#x0D;\nThe two halves of the left main gear spring assembly were recovered and shipped to the National Transportation Safety Board’s Materials Laboratory for examination. &#x0D;\nThe left main gear spring assembly was inspected using X-ray Fluorescence and was found to be consistent with an alloy steel. Hardness measurements were taken per American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) E18. The average hardness was found to be 50 HRC, consistent with alloy steel in a quenched and tempered condition. &#x0D;\nFurther cleaning and examination revealed the surface exhibited chevron marks radiating from an area on the lower surface. Three adjacent thumbnail-shaped features radiated from the lower surface. The largest of these features measured 0.18 inches (4.6 mm) across, with a depth of 0.054 inches (1.4 mm). This feature exhibited a series of parallel ratchet marks, indicative of multiple small cracks joining into a larger singular crack. The piece was then examined in a field-emission scanning electron microscope. The surface in the thumbnail features exhibited a mix of fatigue striations and intergranular decohesion features. Outside of these regions, the surface showed primarily ductile dimpling interspersed with intergranular facets consistent with overstress.&#x0D;\nThe piece was again subjected to acetone cleaning in an ultrasound bath to strip paint and primer away from the bottom edge of the leg. The surface had a dimpled appearance, consistent with shot peening. Corrosion product was observed in the dimples. The piece was subjected to further cleaning in acetone and a soft scrubbing pad was used to remove primer that continued to adhere. Corrosion product was observed on the surface after the primer was removed.&#x0D;\nReview of the airframe maintenance logbook revealed a handwritten write up dated April 1, 2010, that stated in part, “Main gear sent to TD Aero for magna flux, retemper.” &#x0D;\nTwo TD Aerospace Machine Inc. Form TD8130 (1/10) maintenance documents, dated March 18, 2010, one for each of the main landing gear, were reviewed. Each form stated, in part, “Main gear spring: clean and inspect per AC 43.13-1B, Chapter 4 Section 1 and 2. Chapter 5 Section 1,2,4 (Ref ASTM E1444-94A) 5,6,7,10, and 12. Repaired per the Cessna 206 Service Manual and MIL-H-6875 where applicable, Dimensions, Heat Treat and Shot Peened checking against Cessna drawing 142 1601. Magnetic particle inspection, per ASTM-E-1444-94A, CLASS B. Zinc-rich primer meeting TIP-1757A, MIL-P-6889A type 1 MIL-P-8585A type 1 applied. Primer coating meets corrosion/rust protection requirements of AC 43.13 1B Section 3 and the Cessna 206 service manual.” Attempts to contact TD Aerospace Machine were unsuccessful. &#x0D;\nAccording to the owner, the operator maintained the fleet in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations 43, appendix D and inspection of the main landing gear springs was on that checklist and the inspection addressed corrosion, cracks or damage. A review of maintenance manuals revealed the last annual inspection occurred on August 15, 2023. No anomalies were noted in the maintenance logbook. -",

The left main and nose gear tires were low, so he serviced them with air and then performed a series of engine run-ups, high-speed taxi tests, and takeoff rolls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine lost all power shortly after the first takeoff and the pilot performed a forced landing into a residential area just beyond the airport perimeter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed significant quantities of water in the fuel system. It had rained during the two-week period leading up to the accident and the airplane had been stored outside. The airplane had only flown for a few hours over the 4 years leading up to the accident and showed significant evidence of corrosion and non-use; the fuel cap gaskets had degraded such that an adequate seal was not possible.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the pilot did not find water in the fuel tanks before the flight, examination revealed evidence of long-standing water contamination at the fuel tanks in an area away from the drain port. Given the general poor condition of the airplane and the evidence of water contamination, it is likely that the airplane was not sitting level for significant periods, possibly due to a deflated nose strut in combination with the two low tires.

    "FactualNarrative": "On September 20, 2023, about 0830 Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 172N, N733ZN, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Compton, California. The pilot sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane had not been flown for about 2 months and because of this, the pilot planned to perform what he referred to as a “return to service test flight” flight for the owner, departing from Compton/Woodley Airport (CPM). He performed a preflight inspection and visually checked fuel quantity through the filler cap openings, cross-checked the quantity with the fuel gauges, and observed between 7 and 10 gallons per side. He checked the wing tank fuel drains for water and found none.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left main and nose gear tires were low, so the pilot taxied the airplane to the fuel island to service them with air. Because the airplane had been sitting outside unused, he planned to perform a long engine run-up and a series of high-speed taxi runs and takeoff rolls. The run-up lasted between 15 to 20 minutes, during which he noticed that the engine was running rough on the right magneto. He pushed the throttle to the full forward position and leaned the mixture to resolve the issue; after another engine run-up, the roughness had resolved.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe then began the high-speed takeoff runs and, with normal indications, he decided to continue with a flight on the third attempt. After reaching about 50 to 100 ft above ground level, the engine momentarily lost power, followed a short time later by a complete loss of power. He performed a forced landing directly ahead which resulted in substantial damage to the left wing and forward fuselage after striking a parked vehicle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – Airplane on its nose at the accident site (photo courtesy of LA County Sheriff)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn annual inspection was completed on July 15, 2023. The following day 20 gallons of fuel was added, and the airplane was returned to service. At the time of the accident, the airplane had accrued an additional 1.7 hours of flight. Before the most recent annual, the last maintenance event occurred in November 2019 and was again for an annual inspection. During those intervening 4 years the airplane accrued 2 hours of flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left fuel tank was breached during the accident and was observed by first response personal to be leaking fuel. A sheriff’s deputy checked the fuel quantity through the filler neck in the right tank and observed fuel at a depth of 3 inches. The nose gear assembly used a standard air/oil strut, which had folded aft and detached during the accident, so the airplane was in a nose-down attitude when the fuel level was checked.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed that the airplane exhibited evidence of long-term non-use, such as corrosion within the engine compartment and many airframe skin surfaces (see Figure 4), along with mold-like deposits on cabin upholstery and plastic facias.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA complete examination of the fuel system revealed that the fuel strainer was full of fluid, which appeared to be about ¼ blue-colored fuel, and ¾ water (see Figure 2). The carburetor bowl was drained and contained 75 ml of fuel and 25 ml of water (see Figure 3). Additionally, about 10 ml of water was found in the right fuel tank. Internal fuel tank inspection showed globules of water were still present inside the right tank. The lower surfaces of both tanks exhibited corrosion-like discoloration at their respective roots and forward towards the wing leading edge. Removal of both the left and right tank fuel drains, which were located at the rear of each tank, revealed about ¼ inch corrosion to their lower surfaces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccident damage prevented an assessment of the condition of the nose gear strut assembly to confirm if it had been adequately serviced.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 – Fuel and water in strainer&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3 - Fuel and water in carburetor&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right and left fuel cap rubber gaskets were degraded, brittle and cracked, and neither was providing a firm seal against the tank filler neck. The left tank gasket was completely severed by a crack that breached its entire radius (see Figure 4).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4 – Cracked left fuel tank cap gasket and tank skin corrosion&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCessna Single Engine Service Bulletin SEB 92-26 revision 1 provided a modification for installing additional fuel drains in the wing fuel tanks. The modification was designed to assist in the detection and removal of water or other contaminants in the tanks. Although Cessna stated that compliance was mandatory, FAA regulations do not require adherence to service bulletins for Part 91 operations, and the bulletin had not been applied to the accident airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was stored outside and rain showers had passed through the area during the two-week period leading up to the accident. -",

About ¼ mile west of the powerlines, the airplane made a left turning dive and subsequently impacted a cornfield. &#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest inverted on a southerly heading about 10 ft from the initial impact point. Both wing leading edges were crushed aft. All airplane components were located except for a majority of the wire deflector cable and a 10 inch section of the top of the vertical stabilizer, which were not recovered. &#x0D;\nWire impact marks were observed about 18 inches below the top of the vertical stabilizer. The rudder separated from the vertical stabilizer and was found underneath the left wing.&#x0D;\nThe inflatable restraints (airbags) were deployed. No preimpact anomalies were observed with the flight control system. The three propeller blades exhibited rotational signatures. &#x0D;\nThe SATLOC and handheld Garmin GPS units were recovered for data download.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On September 17, 2023, about 1355 Pacific daylight time, a North American T-6G, N2897G (Race 6), and a North American AT-6B, N57418 (Race 14), were substantially damaged when they were involved in an accident near Reno, Nevada.  The pilots of both airplanes were fatally injured.  Both airplanes were operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses reported observing both Race 14 and Race 6 collide while in the airport traffic pattern for runway 8.  One witness, reported that Race 14 was on base leg (southerly heading) for runway 8, oriented along the airport perimeter fence line about 300 ft above ground level (agl), and Race 6, was on downwind, on a west-south-west heading about 300 ft agl.  The witness stated that at the time of the collision, Race 6 was at about a 75° angle in relation to the flight path of Race 14.  &#x0D;\nAnother witness, the pilot of Race 66, who was in the third position to land, reported after he had completed the race, he began a slow left turn to downwind.  As he was about to complete the turn onto downwind, he heard the pilots of Race 14 and Race 6 both transmit “downwind, abeam.”  The pilot of Race 66 stated that he continued to slow his airplane to “create some space and time to see them.” He heard Race 14 transmit “base with gear.”  As he got close to turning onto the base leg for the runway, he spotted Race 6, and transmitted downwind abeam.  The pilot of Race 66 stated that he “finally spotted” Race 14 below his position to the right and on the base leg, and saw Race 6 in level flight, to his left, noting both airplanes were not where he expected them to be.  He added that Race 14 was on a “wider base” than the previous 2 flights, and Race 6 was “tighter” than his position.  The pilot of Race 66 stated that Race 14 crossed in front of his position from right to left and disappeared [from view] on the right side of the engine cowling and Race 6 disappeared under his left wing.  The pilot of Race 66 transmitted base with gear and began a left turn to the base leg for runway 8.  Shortly after, he observed Race 14 where he expected him to be in level flight, with “nothing behind the passenger seat” briefly before it began to roll to the right and descend in a nose low attitude.  &#x0D;\nReview of recorded radio transmissions after the completion of the race revealed that the pilot of Race 14 reported downwind abeam.  About 30 seconds later, the pilot of Race 6 reported downwind abeam, followed by another transmission from the pilot of Race 14 reporting base with gear 4 seconds later.  Several transmissions were heard from pilots of other aircraft reporting downwind abeam until the announcement of a red flag about 1 minute, 11 seconds after Race 14’s initial transmission. &#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed a debris path originated about 7,881 ft northwest of the approach end of runway 8 and extended south to the main wreckage of Race 14 and was about 1,366 ft in length. Identified pieces of Race 14 in the debris field included segments of the left aileron, segments of the left flap, right horizontal stabilizer, right elevator, sections of aft fuselage skin, and a plastic pouch with the airplane documents. Small pieces of black painted skin and plexiglass from Race 6 were identified in the debris field.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage of Race 6 came to rest in an open field. The wing structure was separated from the fuselage and the outboard left wing was separated at the attach joint. The wing sections were located about 30 ft south of the main wreckage. The fuselage was compressed aft significantly. The vertical stabilizer, rudder, tailwheel, left horizontal stabilizer, left elevator, and portions of fuselage skin from Race 14 were found comingled with the wreckage of Race 6.  All major structural components of Race 6 were located within about 50 ft of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\nThe wreckage of Race 14 came to rest in an open sagebrush field. The entire wing section was compressed aft, separated from the fuselage, and located about 10 ft from the main fuselage wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Wreckage location diagram.",

The engine briefly regained power, which allowed the pilot to quickly turn onto the base leg and then onto final approach, but the engine lost power again. The airplane landed hard on the runway, fractured the main landing gear, and nosed over. The postaccident engine examination did not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures. The reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined based on available information.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On September 17, 2023, about 1120 eastern daylight time, an experimental Liore et Oliver Nieuport 28, Swedish registration SE-BMA, was substantially damaged when it was involved in accident near Hudson, Massachusetts. The pilot was not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, he was flying the airplane in the airport traffic pattern when, on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern for runway 17, the engine lost power briefly. He was going to set up for an off-field landing when the engine regained power. He turned onto the base leg and then quickly turned onto the final approach when the engine lost power again. The airplane landed hard on the runway and the main landing gear fractured, resulting in a nose-over. The airplane’s wings, engine mounts, and braces were substantially damaged.&#x0D;\nA Federal Aviation Administration inspector observed the postaccident engine examination conducted by a mechanic who was familiar with the 1918 Gnome 9N rotary engine. The rotary engine’s mixture and throttle settings were set on the ground and no adjustments could be made during flight. The pilot could only turn on/off electrical ignition pulses to the engine cylinders to control power. The examination did not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the engine. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot of the banner tow airplane performed a normal takeoff and stayed in the airport traffic pattern for the banner pickup. The pilot described that after successfully capturing the pickup rope, he climbed with the engine at full power, the flaps retracted, and at a speed of about 45 to 50 mph. The airplane drifted left before the banner left the ground, and the pilot attempted to correct the flight path to the right. The airplane and banner subsequently climbed above the nearby trees, after which the pilot released the banner. The airplane then abruptly pitched up, the right wing “dropped,” and the airplane entered a 180-degree spin to the right that continued to ground impact. The pilot was seriously injured and the airplane was substantially damaged during the impact with trees and terrain.&#x0D;\nThe operator reported, and a post accident examination by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector confirmed, that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airplane and its flight controls that would have precluded normal operation. The operator also reported that it was their company’s standard procedure to climb the airplane at a speed of 55 mph with the flaps extended 10 degrees in order to achieve best climb out. Additionally, when releasing a banner, the prescribed procedure included pushing forward on the control yoke to prevent an abrupt pitch up. Based on this information, it is likely that the pilot climbed at too low an airspeed during the banner pickup, resulting in a loss of control, his decision to release the banner, and the uncorrected pitch up of the airplane that ultimately resulted in the aerodynamic stall/spin.",

    "FactualNarrative": "On September 14, 2023, about 1300 central daylight time, a Cessna 182P airplane, N8443M, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Prospect, Tennessee. The private pilot and one passenger sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot was performing a cross-country flight from Tuscaloosa National Airport (TCL), Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to Lebanon Municipal Airport (M54), Lebanon, Tennessee. About 1 hour into the flight, at 3,500 ft mean sea level, there was a “sudden severe engine vibration and loss of power.” He reduced the throttle to lessen the engine vibration. He elected to land the airplane in a soybean field since he was unsure if he would clear a large, forested area between him and the next closest airport. After touchdown in the soybean field, the nose landing gear struck a ditch, separated, and the airplane nosed over, coming to rest inverted. He called 911 and was met by first responders.&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration inspectors responded to the accident site and examined the wreckage. The wreckage was found inverted, in the soybean field. There was no fire. The fuselage and empennage were substantially damaged.&#x0D;\nAfter recovery of the wreckage, the engine was examined on the airframe. The rocker covers were removed to examine the cylinder heads and check valve action. The Nos. 1-5 cylinders were normal in appearance and the valve action was correct. When the rocker cover for the No. 6 cylinder was removed, pieces of the exhaust valve rocker boss, the rocker, washers, and the rocker shaft were loose inside. The exhaust valve was closed. The rocker boss was fractured in two places.&#x0D;\nThe loose parts recovered from the No. 6 cylinder were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory for examination. One of the rocker boss fragments exhibited features consistent with fatigue that initiated at multiple sites along the bore surface that had been in contact with the arm. The other boss fragment was fractured from overstress, exhibiting features consistent with rapid fracture of an aluminum casting.&#x0D;\nA review of the engine logbook revealed that the engine cylinders were removed, overhauled, and reinstalled on May 18, 2020, at 2,609.8 hours total aircraft time. At the time of the accident, the airplane had accrued about 154 hours since the cylinders were overhauled. -",

The private pilot was fatally injured, and the passenger was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14?Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger, who held a student pilot certificate, reported he was interested in buying the airplane and had been in communication with the pilot, who told him the day before that the annual inspection was just completed and to come to the airport the next day to go flying. After the passenger arrived at the airport on the day of the accident, the pilot stated that the airplane was flown earlier that day. The passenger further reported that the pilot performed a “walk around” inspection which included a check of the wings, lights, aft empennage, and control surfaces. Both occupants boarded the airplane, and the passenger was seated in the right seat. He added that prior to the flight he was not aware that the airplane was equipped with lapbelts, thus he was not wearing it. After engine start the pilot taxied the airplane to the approach end of the runway where the passenger questioned the pilot about the need for an engine run-up; however, the pilot said that it was not necessary because he had done one earlier that day.&#x0D;\nThe airport director, who was at the airport reported that while the airplane was taxiing, he heard the engine misfiring, “not bad, but it was misfiring.” He watched the airplane takeoff to the south and reported that during the takeoff roll the engine sounded normal. The airplane climbed slowly, or more slowly than he thought it should, to between 600 and 700 feet. He lost sight of the airplane and went home. &#x0D;\nThe passenger reported that the flight was airborne for about 3 to 5 minutes. He recalled that the pilot said there was a wind gust and then he pulled aft on the control yoke, while the airplane was close to the tops of nearby trees. The next thing the passenger recalled was waking up postaccident. When asked if he detected a change in engine sound from takeoff to the accident, he said that although he was not wearing a headset, he did not detect any change in engine sound.&#x0D;\nA witness near the accident site who was in her home reported hearing the engine operating and attributed the airplane to be flying low because of the sound. She then heard the engine sound stop, followed by the sound of impact.&#x0D;\nThe airplane impacted a shallow ditch in a residential area and came to rest upright. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was recovered for further examination of the airframe and engine.",

Removal of the induction system revealed remnants of a high-temperature cloth between the air filter and particle screen. No additional cloth debris was observed in the filter or induction screen. &#x0D;\nThe carburetor remained secure at its mount and when the throttle was actuated by hand fuel was expelled from the accelerator pump port. The carburetor fuel screen was free of debris. The carburetor was removed and disassembled with no discrepancies noted. Fuel was obtained from the airframe fuel filter, carburetor, and fuel tank; all fuel samples were free of debris and blue in color.&#x0D;\nA review of the weather conditions reported by Blanding Municipal Airport (BDG), Blanding, Utah, about 21 nautical miles southwest of the accident site, indicated a temperature of 64.4°F, and a dew point of 50°F around the time of the accident. -",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On September 12, 2023, about 2047 Alaska daylight time, a Piper PA-18-150, N109T, sustained substantial damage when it was involved in an accident near St. Mary’s, Alaska. The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo days before the accident, the pilot ferried a group of five hunters, a guide, and their equipment from the operator’s base in Holy Cross, Alaska. The group then set up camp next to the landing strip, which was oriented north-south within hilly terrain about 80 miles northwest of Holy Cross.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe group planned to hunt for a moose and prepare it for transportation back to the operator’s base. During the day before the accident, the group successfully hunted a moose and coordinated with the pilot, via satellite messaging devices, to ferry the meat the next day. On the day of the accident, the pilot arrived at the camp about 1540. The pilot and hunters loaded the airplane with the first batch of meat, and the airplane departed to the north from the airstrip. After takeoff, the airplane made an uneventful climbing right turn over an adjacent ridgeline that paralleled the airstrip to the east and then continued in the general direction of Holy Cross.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot returned to camp about 1940 for the second and final load of meat. During the next hour, the pilot and the hunters loaded the airplane with the meat. One of the hunters reported that the airplane held about 50 to 70 pounds more meat than during the previous flight. The meat was strapped into the rear passenger seat area with both the seatbelt and rope and was loaded into the airplane’s belly pod, which did not have tie-down provisions. The pilot then tied the antlers to the right wing strut; the antlers were cupped outward and perpendicular to the direction of flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot told a hunter that he had performed fuel calculations and would be at reserve fuel levels on arrival at Holy Cross. Both discussed the weather and observed that the wind at the airstrip was generally calm and from the north but that the wind was also intermittently variable and gusting. Members of the group reported to the pilot that the wind was gusting much stronger at the departure end of the airstrip.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot then boarded the airplane and positioned it for a departure to the north. The hunters noticed that the ground roll was slightly longer than before, and that the airplane appeared to be more “labored” than during the previous flight. They stated that, as the airplane reached the end of the airstrip, it pitched up and turned sharply to the right but, rather than climbing as before, the airplane flew behind the adjacent ridgeline and out of view. The group initially thought that the pickup had been successful, but the airplane did not reappear from behind the ridge. The group ran to the top of the ridgeline, looked down, and saw that the airplane had crashed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne of the hunters approached the accident site and found the pilot still conscious. The hunter activated the SOS feature on his satellite messenger device, but the pilot succumbed to his injuries within two hours of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane’s emergency locator transmitter activated during the accident, and an alert signal was received by the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center about 2048. According to the hunters, an Alaska Air National Guard team arrived at the accident site via helicopter between 0130 and 0200 on September 13.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne of the hunters recorded a video of the accident takeoff. The video showed that the airplane began the ground roll at the southern end of the airstrip and departed to the north and uphill. The flaps were retracted, and the tail of the airplane came up as soon as the pilot applied engine power (see figure 1). The ground roll lasted about 530 ft, and, immediately after takeoff, the airplane pitched up and rolled about 20° right. The airplane then appeared to roll to a wings level attitude. The video ended a few seconds later and it did not capture the accident. The engine was heard operating during the recording, and the airplane was not trailing smoke or vapors.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Airplane during the takeoff roll (Source: Hunter video).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA team comprised of the National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge and technical representatives from the Federal Aviation Administration, Piper Aircraft, and Lycoming Engines responded to the accident and arrived on site on September 15. Examination revealed that the airplane came to rest on a 30° downward slope on the other side of the adjoining ridgeline, at an elevation of 1,210 ft mean sea level, about 10 ft lower, and 600 ft east of the departure end of the airstrip (see figure 2). The surrounding area consisted of rolling hills covered in tundra, grass, and low&#x1E;lying shrubs and bushes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage was on a north heading, and both wings remained partially attached and generally in line with each other on a northwest-southeast orientation. The first identified point of impact, which was located about 20 ft below the main wreckage, consisted of a divot in the soil that contained blue and white fragments that matched the right wingtip (see figure 3). Next, the right wing landing light assembly and right window frame were located about 5 ft uphill in a west direction. A large divot in the soil, which was located 5 ft farther uphill, matched the general dimensions of a main landing gear tire. Adjacent to this hole was the propeller, which had separated from the crankshaft. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Accident site with the first point of impact in the foreground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine contained oil, and no evidence indicated a catastrophic engine failure. Although the wing tank fuel lines had been breached, residual quantities of fuel were observed in both tanks. Both propeller blades exhibited similar damage, including tip twist, leading-edge nicks and dents, trailing-edge S-bending, and chordwise scratches.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane cargo was weighed at the accident site, revealing a load of about 520 pounds that consisted primarily of moose meat and a set of moose antlers. About 150 pounds of meat was found in the forward section of the belly pod; the remaining portions were firmly secured in the rear cabin seating area. The antlers were secured to the inboard side of the right-wing strut.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On September 12, 2023, about 1400 central daylight time, a Thrush Aircraft LLC S2R-T660 airplane, N710TY, was substantially damaged during an accident near Ardoch, North Dakota. The pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 137 aerial-application flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was to spray a sunflower field. The flight departed from a private airstrip near Oslo, Minnesota, and the last known contact with the pilot was about 1345.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn onsite examination revealed that the airplane’s left wing impacted a guy wire that attached to a power line structure located on the west edge of the field being sprayed. Based on the wreckage distribution, the airplane was flying to the south when the left wing impacted the guy wire on the west side of the power line structure, as depicted in figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 3/8-inch outside diameter guy wire normally attached to the pole crossarm near the top of the 73 ft tall pole. According to the power company, the guy wire was about 95 ft long and attached to the pole crossarm about 65 ft above ground level. The guy wire was anchored to the ground about 62 ft west of the pole. Examination of the guy wire, which had separated from the pole during impact, revealed damage about 82 ft from the ground anchor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the guy wire impact, the outboard 7 ft of the left wing and left aileron separated and were located south of the guy wire strike in an adjacent soybean field. The separated portion of the left wing exhibited evidence of a wire strike through the wing leading edge and along the forward spar, as shown in figure 2.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane continued south about 0.3 miles before it impacted a cornfield on an east-southeast bearing. The airplane impacted the cornfield in a left wing down and nose down attitude. The main wreckage, as shown in figure 3, was located about 155 ft on 101° bearing from the initial ground impact. An impact crater was located about 50 ft east-southeast of the initial impact point. The engine, propeller, and main landing gear separated during impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Accident site overview&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExcept for the previously discussed outboard 7 ft of left wing and left aileron, all structural components and flight control surfaces were located at the accident site. Examination of the airplane wreckage revealed no evidence of a preimpact malfunction that would have prevented its normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane’s digital engine monitor, spray system computer, spray system display, and spray system light bar, along with the pilot’s Apple iPhone and his Apple iPad Mini, were shipped to the National Transportation Safety Board Vehicle Recorder Laboratory, Washington, DC, for additional examination and possible data extraction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2.

While on approach to the destination airport, the previous passengers notified the pilot that they were ready to be picked up, so the pilot did not land and turned the airplane back toward the departure airport. The pilot climbed to 10,000 ft and noticed the airplane’s fuel burn was high, so he climbed to 16,000 ft. The pilot reported that “everything was routine until about a 3-mile final” to the runway, when the controller asked the pilot to slow to a final approach speed. An airplane was still on the runway, so the controller told the pilot to go around. The pilot told controllers twice that he had minimum fuel available. &#x0D;\nThe pilot continued on a visual approach for the same runway when the right engine lost power followed by the left engine. He feathered both propellers and made a forced landing to a wooded area. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, both wings, and the empennage. The pilot reported that there were no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot later stated that he was “trying to do too much with too little” fuel and the accident was a result of poor fuel management. Although the controller directed the pilot to go around, the pilot should have recognized the criticality of the minimum fuel situation and landed the airplane.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "United Airlines flight 1759 encountered moderate turbulence while descending through 11,000 ft for landing at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) Hebron, Kentucky, and a flight attendant (FA) fractured her pelvis.&#x0D;\nThe flight crew reported that while descending on the SARGO-3 arrival into CVG they observed a single cloud with no apparent vertical development at about 11,000 ft. With no indication of an adverse ride from air traffic control (ATC), their onboard weather applications or their weather radar, the pilots elected to continue. Upon entering the cloud, the flight encountered about 2 seconds of moderate turbulence. Following the turbulence encounter the flight crew received a call from the cabin advising them that a FA had been injured.&#x0D;\nThe aft FA assigned to jumpseat 2L reported that she was completing her duties in the aft galley and was seated in her jumpseat but had not fastened her safety harness, when suddenly and without warning, they encountered severe turbulence. She was thrown into the air, struck the ceiling and impacted the floor on her side fracturing her pelvis. Upon being notified of the injury, the flight crew declared a medical emergency and requested paramedics meet the aircraft at the gate. The injured FA was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured pelvis.  &#x0D;\nAt the time of the turbulence encounter there were no active significant meteorological information (SIGMETs), convective SIGMETs, airman’s meteorological information (AIRMETs), or pilot reports (PIREPs) of any significant turbulence.",

The pilot subsequently performed a forced landing to a field. During the landing, the landing gear collapsed, and the airplane came to rest upright. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector revealed substantial damage to the composite structure of the lower fuselage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was further examined following its transport to a recovery facility. Recovery and maintenance personnel reported that the fuel tank remained intact and contained no fuel. Additionally, the engine-driven fuel pump, fuel lines, and carburetors contained no fuel. A mechanic installed a temporary magneto switch as the ignition key was lost during the accident. He then attached a 16-oz bottle of gasoline to the inlet side of the engine-driven fuel pump via a clean fuel hose.

    "PrelimNarrative": "On September 6, 2023, about 1148 central daylight time, a Cessna 150K airplane, N6059G, was substantially damaged during an accident at the Huntsville Municipal Airport (UTS), Huntsville, Texas. The flight instructor and student pilot were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data that was transmitted from the airplane to Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control, at 1027, the airplane departed from runway 14 at North Houston Regional Airport (CXO), Conroe, Texas. The airplane flew northeast about 6 nautical miles before it turned northwest toward UTS. About 1050, the airplane entered the traffic pattern for runway 36 at UTS. The airplane flew 6 traffic patterns consistent with touch-and-go landings on runway 36. The airplane descended below ADS-B coverage about 700 ft mean sea level (msl), or about 337 ft above airport elevation, while it operated in the traffic pattern at UTS. About 1128, the airplane switched landing direction to use runway 18. The airplane flew 3 additional traffic patterns consistent with touch-and-go landings on runway 18. At 1146:54, the last ADS-B return was recorded about 830 feet msl while the airplane was descending on the base leg for runway 18.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo witnesses reported that the airplane was flying in the airport traffic pattern before the accident. They were on the ramp preparing for an instructional flight when they heard a sudden decrease in engine rpm. They turned and saw the airplane flying southbound over runway 18, about 500 ft above the ground, rocking its wings in a level pitch attitude. The airplane then entered a left, nose down, turn toward the east. The flight instructor believed that the pilot of the accident airplane was attempting to make a left 180° turn to land on runway 36. He stated that after the airplane turned about 90° it entered a spin and descended to the ground in a nose down pitch attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn on-scene examination revealed that the main wreckage was about 407 ft south of the end of runway 18 and about 40 ft east of the extended runway centerline. The airplane came to rest upright and nose down on a west heading, as shown in figure 1. The leading edge of both wings were crushed aft to their respective main spars.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Main wreckage at the accident site&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe elevators, ailerons, and rudder flight control surfaces, trim tabs, and the flaps were accounted for at the accident site. Flight control cable continuity was confirmed from the cockpit to the respective flight control surfaces. The cockpit control column exhibited impact-related damage. The aileron control chain remained intact and partially attached to each control column sprocket. The aileron forward bellcrank/arm assembly remained attached to the control column with attached cables. The aileron balance cable remained continuous between the aileron bellcranks. The elevator control tube remained attached to the cockpit control column. The aft end of the elevator control tube was displaced aft about 6 inches and separated from the elevator forward bellcrank, which fractured into two halves with attached cables; the fracture exhibited signatures consistent with an overstress separation due to impact related damage. The rudder cables were continuous from the cockpit pedals to the rudder control horn.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left and right ailerons remained attached to their respective wing attachment points. The rudder remained attached to its attachment points on the vertical stabilizer. The left and right elevators remained attached to their respective horizontal stabilizer. The elevator trim actuator extension measured 1.4 inches and was consistent with a neutral trim tab position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left and right flaps remained attached to their respective wing attachment points. The flap handle in the cockpit was found in the UP position. The flap actuator/motor was found in the fully retracted position and was consistent with the flaps fully retracted at impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage examination did not reveal any preimpact flight control anomalies that would have prevented normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the left- and right-wing metal fuel tanks exhibited hydraulic deformation along the forward and top tank surfaces. The left and right fuel tank finger screen strainers were unobstructed. The fuel lines from each wing fuel tank to the fuel shutoff valve assembly remained intact. The fuel lines from each wing fuel tank combined through a Y-shaped fuel fitting upstream of the fuel shutoff valve, as depicted in figure 2. The fuel line from the fuel shutoff valve assembly to the fuel strainer assembly was impact separated about 2 inches forward of the fuel shutoff valve assembly. The fuel strainer assembly was displaced aft through the firewall into the cockpit floor area. The filter bowl was separated from the fuel strainer assembly and was impact damaged. The fuel strainer screen filter remained attached to the fuel strainer and exhibited debris. The fuel line from the fuel strainer assembly to the carburetor was separated and not observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel line connected to the inlet port of the fuel shutoff valve was removed and fuel-wetted debris was seen inside the elbow fuel fitting. The debris obstructed the elbow fuel fitting, as shown in figure 3a. The fuel shutoff valve outlet port exhibited accumulated debris affixed to its inside diameter, as shown in figure 3b. Additional debris was recovered from inside the shutoff valve when tapped on a table, as shown in figure 4.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel line from each wing fuel tank was disconnected and air blown through the fuel line to the disconnected line at the fuel shutoff valve. Fuel and traces of debris was extracted from the left and right fuel lines. The recovered debris was similar to the debris found in the inlet/outlet ports of the fuel shutoff valve, as shown in figures 5a and 5b. A borescope examination of the left- and right-wing fuel tanks revealed additional loose debris inside each fuel tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel shutoff valve and the recovered debris from the fuel lines were retained for additional laboratory examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Fuel system schematic&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Fuel shutoff valve inlet port (3a) and outlet port (3b)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. Fuel shutoff valve and debris recovered from inlet port&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Debris recovered from the left fuel line (5a) and right fuel line (5b)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was displaced upwards, compressed aft into the firewall, and was rotated/twisted to the left side of the aircraft. The starter separated from the engine, but the remaining accessories remained attached to the engine. The engine crankshaft did not rotate by hand through the propeller. The crankshaft was displaced aft about 0.5 inches, consistent with damage associated with a nose down impact. The removal of the rear accessories revealed additional damage to the accessory gears consistent with the entire crankshaft being displaced aft of its normal position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBorescope examination of each cylinder reveal no anomalies with the cylinders, pistons, valves, valve seats, or bottom spark plugs. There were no mechanical failures observed during a borescope examination of the drive train components. There was evidence of ample oil in the crankcase, accessory gearbox, valve covers, and the oil filter. The spin-on type oil filter was removed, cut open, and exhibited no evidence of debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth magnetos produced spark at all four leads when rotated by hand. The impulse coupling for each magneto functioned normally. The spark plugs exhibited features consistent with normal engine operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor separated from the engine during impact. The engine control continuity to the carburetor could not be established due to impact related damage. The intake air box assembly remained attached to the carburetor but exhibited impact damage. The carburetor heat control cable separated from the intake air box.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor fuel inlet with inlet screen fractured from the carburetor body during impact and was not located during the investigation. The fuel line from the fuel strainer assembly to the carburetor was not located. The throttle valve did not rotate due to impact damage. The carburetor fuel bowl contained about 1 fluid ounce of uncontaminated 100 low-lead aviation fuel. There was no evidence of sediment or debris in the carburetor fuel bowl. The fuel metering float and float valve appeared intact and functional.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine examination revealed no evidence of a preexisting mechanical malfunction or failure that would have prevented normal operation.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "After flying about 200 miles from his home airport, the pilot performed an uneventful night landing. After taxiing to the end of the runway he decided to perform another takeoff and landing for night currency. There was no traffic in the pattern, and after takeoff he retracted the landing gear. Once at pattern altitude, he stabilized the airplane in preparation for landing on the longest runway. During the final approach he adjusted the throttle, mixture, flaps, and propeller, but missed the step to extend the landing gear. The pilot stated that during the landing he did not recall hearing the gear warning horn, although it had worked during the preflight inspection. The airplane landed gear-up about midfield down the runway and sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage structure. Following the accident, the pilot secured the airplane by shutting off the fuel selector valve and turning off the airplane’s master switch (which also controlled its external lights).&#x0D;\nThe airport served air carrier operations and was located within Class D airspace until 2000 local, one hour before the accident, when the air traffic control tower closed, and the airspace reverted to Class G (uncontrolled). About the time of the accident, an Embraer E175 air carrier flight was inbound for landing on the accident runway, but from the opposite direction. A member of the airport operations department was performing a routine wildlife runway inspection and observed the accident. He warned the inbound air carrier flight that the runway was obstructed, and the crew initiated a missed approach, and diverted to another airport.&#x0D;\nThe first officer from the air carrier flight stated that he heard the accident airplane make position announcements while in the pattern, but that had it not been for the announcement by airport operations personal that the runway was obstructed, they would likely have continued the approach and landed with the unlit airplane still occupying the runway.&#x0D;\nThe airport typically served about 218 air carrier flight takeoffs and landings per week during the period of the accident, 13 of which were due to operate after the control tower was closed.",

The airplane pilot had broadcast his position over a common traffic advisory frequency for the area. The helicopter pilot was monitoring the common traffic advisory frequency and was also monitoring automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B) data from other aircraft on a moving map display; however, the airplane was not ADS-B equipped. The airplane pilot did not see the helicopter in time to avoid the collision. The helicopter pilot never saw the airplane and was unaware that his helicopter had collided with the airplane until after the accident.  &#x0D;\nAs a result of the midair collision, the airplane sustained minor damage to the floats and propeller, and the helicopter sustained substantial damage to the fuselage, tail boom, and drive train system.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On September 4, 2023, about 1610 Alaska daylight time, a DeHavilland DHC-2 float equipped-airplane, N97EL, and a Bell 206L-4 helicopter, N193AL, were involved in a midair collision near King Salmon, Alaska. The airplane sustained minor damage; the pilot and six passengers were not injured. The helicopter was substantially damaged; the pilot received minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 business flight. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand charter flight.&#x0D;\nThe airplane departed from the Brooks River about 1600 and flew north to the mouth of the American Creek on a return flight to a lodge on Enchanted Lake. The pilot broadcast a position report over the common traffic advisory frequency while crossing over the mouth of the American Creek and proceeded to fly along the right side of the creek at an estimated altitude of 800 ft mean sea level (msl). About five miles past the reported position, the pilot noticed the passenger sitting next to him looking across the cockpit to the left with a startled look. The pilot looked left and saw a flash of white. He never saw the helicopter before impact. The airplane was traveling at about 90 miles per hour (mph). The airplane was not equipped with ADS-B, nor was it required.     &#x0D;\nThe helicopter departed from King Salmon Airport (PAKN) around 1600 en route to Homer, Alaska. The helicopter pilot reported that, after departure, he climbed the helicopter to about 1,000 ft above ground level (agl) and was flying direct to Homer Airport (PAHO). The helicopter was traveling about 115 mph. &#x0D;\nAs the helicopter passed under the airplane, the airplane’s propeller made contact with the helicopter’s tail boom and tail rotor drive system, which severed the entire tail rotor gearbox assembly from the tail boom. The helicopter subsequently entered a spinning, uncontrolled descent into the tundra and tree-covered terrain below. The airplane began to shake and vibrate violently. The airplane pilot then realized that the airplane had collided with another aircraft and he turned the airplane 180°. The right seat passenger reported to the pilot that a helicopter had hit the airplane and he saw the tail of the helicopter separate and the helicopter crash. &#x0D;\nThe airplane pilot broadcast the downed helicopter’s location over the common traffic advisory frequency and began to direct other aircraft in the area towards the helicopter wreckage. The airplane pilot then made an emergency landing in a nearby river. The airplane sustained minor damage to the floats and propeller.  &#x0D;\nThe helicopter pilot reported that he was monitoring the local traffic advisory frequency at the time of the accident. The helicopter was equipped with ADS-B in and out. The pilot was also using a Stratus that provided ADS-B data from other aircraft in the area on a moving map display on his tablet. He did not see any other aircraft along or near his route of flight on the display. He added that he never saw the airplane and was unaware that his helicopter had collided with the airplane until after the accident.  &#x0D;\nThe nearest weather reporting station, located 34 nautical miles west of the accident site, reported 10 miles visibility with few clouds at 3,500 ft agl. Neither pilot reported any difficulty or restrictions with visibility. -",

The engine had accumulated fewer than 30 hours since factory overhaul. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed that the inboard fuel vent lines were obstructed by insect nests; however, the engine ran at idle power settings during the postaccident engine test run. The engine was not tested at higher power settings due to the crankshaft being bent. Although it is possible that the obstructed fuel vents reduced fuel flow to the engine at higher power settings, the postaccident examination of the engine did not reveal evidence of preimpact malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation; thus, the reason for the loss of engine power could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On September 4, 2023, at 1031 eastern daylight time, a Beech A36, N1WN, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Frankfort, Kentucky. The pilot and three passengers were not injured. The flight was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he had performed a preflight inspection with no anomalies noted before departing Gary/Chicago International Airport (GYY), Gary, Indiana with his passengers for a flight to Greenwood County Airport (GRD), Greenwood, South Carolina. He began the flight with full fuel tanks and the fuel selector set to the right fuel tank. He flew for about an hour before switching to the left fuel tank. About 30-40 minutes later, while in cruise flight at 7,000 ft mean sea level, the engine stopped producing power and the propeller continued to windmill. The pilot disengaged the autopilot, advanced the throttle, and established best glide speed. He declared the emergency to air traffic control who advised him that the nearest airport was Capital City Airport (FFT), Frankfort, Kentucky, about 8 nm ahead. The pilot took no further remedial actions to restore engine power. When he realized that the airplane would not reach the runway at FFT, he landed with the landing gear retracted on airport property, where the airplane slid across a taxiway, struck a taxiway light, and came to rest in the grass. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane revealed that the fuselage sustained lateral scraping and gouging along the belly skin, which was wrinkled aft of the firewall. The left wing was damaged consistent with ground contact. The engine mount structure was bent upward about 3º. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the fuel strainer screen and fuel strainer bowl revealed they were free from debris. Both wing fuel tanks were intact and contained fuel, with the fuel tank caps seated in place. The fuel was tested with water finding paste and was free from contamination. All fuel screens were free of obstructions. Although the inboard fuel vent tubes were obstructed by insect nests, air was passed through the remainder of the fuel vent system with no restriction to airflow noted, and testing of the fuel boost pump revealed that fuel flow was not restricted even with the restricted vent. All spark plugs showed normal wear when compared to a Champion Aerospace Aviation Check-A-Plug chart. Borescope examination of the cylinders revealed no anomalies. Thumb compression was achieved on all cylinders when the propeller was rotated by hand. &#x0D;\nThe impact-damaged propeller was replaced with a serviceable one and the ignition switch was bypassed since the ignition key was not present for the examination. The engine was started using the airplane’s battery, which had retained its charge since the accident. The engine idled at 700 rpm. The right magneto was disconnected, and the engine was started on the left magneto only and ran normally. The right magneto was reconnected, and the left magneto was disconnected, and the engine was started on the right magneto only and ran normally. The crankshaft was slightly bent and produced vibration, so the engine was not operated above idle.&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the airplane. &#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with an engine data monitor; however, no data was recovered from the engine data monitor since the data recording was a user configurable option on the device and was not configured to record any data. Review of maintenance logbooks revealed that the engine had accumulated less than 30 hours since factory overhaul. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On September 3, 2023, about 1900 central daylight time, a Van’s Aircraft RV-12iS airplane, N321BT, sustained substantial damage when it was involved in an accident near Crystal, Minnesota. The pilot sustained minor injuries and the passenger sustained no injury. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe light-sport airplane departed from the Major Gilbert Field Airport (4R5), La Pointe, Wisconsin, about 1725, for the cross-country flight. The intended destination was the Crystal Airport (MIC), Minneapolis, Minnesota. During the landing at MIC, the airplane touched down on runway 24R, which was a dry asphalt runway, and bounced two times.

There was no evidence of any pre-existing damage to the nose landing gear strut.&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has published the Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3C), which discusses bounced landings and states in part:&#x0D;\nSince a bounce occurs when the airplane makes contact with the ground before the proper touchdown attitude is attained, it is almost invariably accompanied by the application of excessive back-elevator pressure. This is usually the result of the pilot realizing too late that the airplane is not in the proper attitude and attempting to establish it just as the second touchdown occurs. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On September 3, 2023, about 1420 Pacific daylight time, a Piper PA-18-135, N7199K, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Compton, California. The pilot sustained minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 banner tow flight.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that shortly after takeoff, during a banner tow operation, the back of the pilot’s seat broke and he slid aft into a horizontal position. The abrupt rearward movement resulted in the pilot pulling back on the control yoke, which caused the airplane to pitch up to a nose-high attitude. Due to the high pitch attitude, the pilot slid further back in the seat. Unable to push the flight control stick forward, he let go of the flight controls and used the crossbeam to pull himself forward. About 200 ft agl, at the onset of an aerodynamic stall, he was able to push the flight control stick forward and recover the airplane. As he recovered from the imminent stall, the airplane’s engine began to “cough” and sustained a partial loss of power. Unable to maintain altitude, he elected to make a forced landing to a nearby baseball field. As the airplane descended toward a baseball field, it impacted a fence along a concrete wash and came to rest upright.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot believes that when he fell back or when he was pulling himself forward, his foot or knee may have moved the fuel selector lever out of the “both/on” position.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane revealed that both wings were substantially damaged. The pilot’s seat back frame was fracture separated on the left and right side near the back rest and seat junction. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s seat was sent to National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory, Washington, DC, for examination. The examination of the fracture surface revealed characteristics consistent with an overstress fracture. A review of the airplane’s maintenance records could not determine the age of the pilot’s seat, or if recent maintenance had been performed on it. -",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On September 2, 2023, at 2218 eastern daylight time, a Cirrus SR20, N420PB, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Toms River, New Jersey. The student pilot was fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 solo instructional flight. &#x0D;\nAccording to the student pilot’s flight instructor, the purpose of the flight was for the pilot to perform solo takeoffs and landings at night. In written statements, other pilots operating at and around Ocean County Airport (MJX) stated that the student pilot was communicative over the airport’s common traffic advisory frequency and identified his airplane as “Cirrus” rather than by its registration number. One pilot stated that he was on short final for landing on runway 24 when the student pilot keyed the pilot-controlled lighting and extinguished the lights. The pilots described a clear night with wind estimated “from the west” about 10 knots. According to one pilot, “RWY 24 was particularly ‘dark’ off the takeoff end due to vegetation/trees below resulting in very little ground references at night – instrument monitoring was essential on climb out.” &#x0D;\nPreliminary Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) track data indicated that the accident occurred during the student pilot’s fourth takeoff following three full-stop landings.  &#x0D;\nDuring the climb over the runway, the airplane’s first target was acquired at 275 ft mean sea level (msl) and 62 knots groundspeed. The airplane climbed to 425 ft before it leveled for about 30 seconds between 425 and 500 ft. The airplane’s groundspeeds in the climb slowed and were steady at 56 knots and once level, the airplane accelerated slowly to about 90 knots groundspeed, where it initiated a descending, accelerating westerly turn until the target disappeared. Two separate airport surveillance videos captured the airplane; the first video showed the airplane in a shallow climb after takeoff before the airplane continued out of frame. The second showed the airplane in a descent below the tree line, followed by a postimpact fire.&#x0D;\nThe student pilot was issued a third-class Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate on March 9, 2022. He reported 0 hours of flight experience on that date. Pilot logbooks were not immediately available, but the student pilot’s flight instructor estimated that the student pilot had accrued between 65 and 70 hours total flight experience, all in the accident airplane. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA and maintenance records, the airplane was manufactured in 2003 and was powered by a Continental IO-360-ES, 210-horsepower engine. The airplane’s most recent annual inspection was completed on May 18, 2023, at 1,692.5 total aircraft hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane came to rest in densely-wooded state forest property covering over 1 million acres adjacent to MJX. The wreckage was examined at the accident site and all major components were accounted for at the scene. The composite airplane was fragmented along a 300-ft long wreckage path, which was oriented about 290° magnetic, and the wreckage was consumed by postcrash fire. The accident ignited a wildfire that prevented access to the wreckage for about 36 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe initial impact point was in trees about 40 ft tall. The damage to the trees was consistent with a shallow, wings-level descent through the trees to ground contact. Pieces of angularly-cut wood were found along the wreckage path. The cockpit instruments and components were consumed by fire and contained no usable information. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was found inverted, with both propeller blades loose in their hubs. The blades displayed similar twisting, bending, and tip curling as well as thermal damage. The engine case was heavily damaged by impact and fire. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered from the site and flight control cables, pulleys, turnbuckles, bellcranks, and the flap actuator were laid out for examination. Aileron control continuity could not be confirmed due to impact and or thermal damage. Rudder and elevator control continuity was established through several breaks from both impact and fire. Measurement of the flap actuator revealed dimensions consistent with the flaps being fully retracted. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) was deployed, and displayed evidence of deployment due to impact forces. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was suspended and rotated by hand at the propeller. Continuity was established from the powertrain through the valvetrain to the accessory section. Compression was confirmed on all but the No. 5 cylinder using the thumb method. The No. 5 intake valve boss was fractured by impact and the valve was separated from its guide. Examination of the cylinders revealed normal wear and combustion deposits. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe magnetos were destroyed by fire. The high-pressure fuel pump was displaced by impact, removed, and partially disassembled. The pump rotated smoothly, and the internal vanes were intact. The flow divider was opened; it contained fuel, and the screen and diaphragm were intact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 1 upper aft crankcase through-bolt was displaced by impact, and the nut on the case side was fractured. The external oil filer was destroyed by impact and fire. The internal oil filter screen was clean of obstruction or debris. Oil was present throughout the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe propeller was removed for further examination. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSun and moon data for Toms River, New Jersey, at the time of the accident revealed that the moon was in the eastern sky at 090° and was 13° above the horizon at the time of the accident.",

    "FactualNarrative": "On September 2, 2023, about 1100 eastern daylight time, a Beech V35 airplane, N5431U, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Rutledge, Tennessee. The airline transport pilot and one passenger were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that the flight departed Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge Airport (GKT), Sevierville, Tennessee, about 1045. The pilot proceeded northbound toward his destination, climbing to 2,500 ft mean sea level. About 15 minutes into the flight, over a forested area, the engine made a “loud bang” and started running rough. As the pilot turned to a southerly heading and an open field, the engine seized. Unable to land in the field, he performed a forced landing into trees. The wreckage came to rest inverted, and the pilot and passenger were met by first responders.&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration inspectors responded to the accident site and examined the wreckage. There was no fire. The fuselage, wings, and empennage were substantially damaged. The external surfaces of the fuselage were covered with engine oil.&#x0D;\nAfter recovery of the wreckage, the engine was removed from the airframe for examination. Several small (about 0.75 inch) holes were found in the upper engine case, and one large hole was found under the area of the left magneto. The oil pan was removed and it contained engine oil and numerous metallic fragments. &#x0D;\nFurther disassembly of the engine revealed that one of the No. 2 crankshaft cheek counterweights was missing. The largest hole in the engine case was directly adjacent to the area where the counterweight liberated.&#x0D;\nThe retaining circlips and plates from the counterweight were found inside the engine. Two of the circlips were fractured, and two were bent but intact. The plates and circlips were forwarded to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for analysis.&#x0D;\nThe circlips were arbitrarily numbered 1 though 4. Circlips 1 and 2 were intact and bent. Circlip 3 was fractured at both leg ends. An examination of both fracture surfaces revealed localized necking and cup-shaped fracture surfaces consistent with overstress. &#x0D;\nCirclip 4 also had both leg ends fractured. One of the fractures was similar to the circlip 3 fractures; however, the other fracture exhibited two thumbnail-shaped cracks along the inner surface. There were also fatigue striations consistent with fatigue crack propagation.&#x0D;\nA review of the aircraft maintenance records revealed that the engine was disassembled and inspected for a propeller strike on November 2, 2020, at 5,061 total airframe hours. The airplane had accrued about 130 hours since this inspection. -",

The pilot received minor injuries and the three passengers were not injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, she departed Cincinnati Municipal Airport/Lunken Field (LUK), Cincinnati, Ohio, about 2010 for a local flight with friends. During cruise flight, at an altitude of 4,500 ft mean sea level, the engine started “sputter” and there was a smell of “burning and avgas.” The pilot made the decision to return to LUK. She contacted the LUK tower about 10 miles away and informed them of the engine trouble. She called the tower again 5 miles from the airport, stated that she experienced complete engine failure, and was heading for the river for a forced landing. She subsequently contacted the tower again and stated that she was unable to reach the river and would be going down in trees about 5 miles from the airport. She secured the engine and the airplane collided with trees and came to rest on its tail section, resulting in substantial damage to the empennage, tail section, and wings.&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that after the engine started to sputter, she switched from the right tip tank to the left main tank, then the right main tank, and subsequently the left tip tank during her troubleshooting attempts. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the engine established compression in each of the cylinders and continuity to the accessory drive section, as the magnetos’ impulse couplings could be heard when the propeller was rotated by hand. The spark plug wires appeared new and in good condition. The fuel flow divider, nor injectors showed any signs of fuel leakage. The propeller blades were straight and not damaged. The spinner dome was impact damaged on one side. There were no signs of oil leakage around the engine.  No anomalies were noted with the engine that would have precluded normal operation. -",

The pilot was helping the owner sell the airplane. While enroute, and about 1 mile south of Ava, Missouri, the engine sustained a loss of oil pressure and a total loss of engine power occurred. During the loss of engine power, engine oil covered the cowling, the windscreen, and the lower fuselage. The pilot performed a forced landing to a grass field and during the landing, the nose gear collapsed. The airplane came to rest upright, but with a nose down attitude. The pilot and the passenger were able to egress from the airplane without further incident.&#x0D;\nThe airplane sustained substantial damage to the lower fuselage and the engine mount. A hole was found in the engine case. The airplane is pending recovering from the field for a future examination. &#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with a Continental Motors IO-470-K reciprocating engine and a Hartzell Propeller aluminum 3-blade controllable pitch propeller. According to the pilot, the airplane had an annual inspection performed on August 1, 2023, and up until the accident, the airplane had a “smooth running engine.”&#x0D;\nThe estimated density altitude for the closest meteorological observation facility was 2,995 ft.",

He said that as he approached the airport, the reported weather indicated the wind was aligned with the runway. During the approach, he noted that the windsock showed a left crosswind, and he adjusted the approach using crosswind control correction for the left crosswind. During the rollout, the wind shifted, and the right wing rose. The pilot attempted to correct but when the wing came back down the airplane veered off the left side of the runway and the right main landing gear collapsed. He said that after the event the windsock showed a right crosswind and he believed that there was some windshear that resulted in the right wing raising during the event. The airplane received substantial damage to the right wing. The pilot reported that there were no mechanical issues with the airplane. The recorded weather at the airport where the accident occurred was from 020° at 3 knots, about the time of the accident.",

The pilot, flight instructor and passenger received minor injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\nIt was reported that the airplane attempted to depart on two other occasions but the pretakeoff engine checks revealed engine roughness during the magneto checks. Both times the airplane was taken back to a maintenance facility for diagnosis. Ultimately one of the engine’s spark plugs was replaced and the subsequent pretakeoff engine checks were satisfactory. &#x0D;\nOn the accident takeoff from runway 01 at ICT, the air traffic controller advised the flight that he saw smoke coming from the airplane. Subsequently the airplane’s engine lost partial power and flight crew executed a forced landing to a field north of the runway. During the landing the airplane crossed a ditch, impacted the opposite side and the nose landing gear and left main landing gear separated from the airplane. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and right wing.",

Of the 14 crew and 151 passengers onboard, 2 crew and 2 passengers sustained serious injuries, and 8 crew and 5 passengers sustained minor injuries. The aircraft sustained minor damage. DAL175 was a 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 scheduled international passenger flight from Milan Malpensa Airport (MXP), Milan, Italy to ATL. &#x0D;\nThe aircraft was flying the OZZZI 1 arrival into ATL with the seatbelt sign illuminated in the cabin. About 10 miles prior to reaching the OZZZI intersection, the flight crew stated they identified a weather radar return about 40 miles ahead near the KILRR intersection and requested a deviation from air traffic control (ATC) about 1827. The air traffic controller requested the aircraft continue to OZZZI before deviating north and the flight crew accepted this instruction noting only a small white cloud near OZZZI. The flight crew stated there were no PIREPs from preceding aircraft, no nearby weather radar returns, nor any significant turbulence indications on their Flight Weather Viewer application. The relief pilot contacted the flight attendants to inform them that they may encounter turbulence in about 5 minutes and suggested they complete their duties within that time. &#x0D;\nWithin about 4 minutes, about 1831, the aircraft entered about 12 seconds of instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) at about 14,000 feet and encountered about 2 seconds of severe turbulence within the cloud. The flight crew were notified of injuries in the cabin, declared an emergency with ATC, and requested emergency medical service (EMS) upon arrival in Atlanta. EMS personnel met the aircraft at the gate, and about 11 people were transported to the hospital for further evaluation. &#x0D;\nA preliminary weather evaluation was conducted by the NTSB post-flight. Figure 1 shows the accident flight path and the composite radar image including the area of building convection that the accident flight penetrated during the event. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. National Weather Service KFFC WSR-88D Composite Reflectivity image for 2234Z with accident flight track overlaid in magenta. Aircraft position at the time the image was created is indicted by the aircraft symbol.&#x0D;\nNTSB specialties investigating this accident: air traffic control, meteorology, cockpit voice recorder, and flight data recorder. Interviews were conducted with air traffic control personnel. Parties to the investigation include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Delta Air Lines and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA). In accordance with the provisions of Annex 13 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, an Accredited Representative from the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses (BEA) of France, the State of Design and Manufacture of the aircraft, was appointed to support the investigation, with Airbus as a technical advisor.",

    "PrelimNarrative": "On August 27, 2023, about 1000 Alaska daylight time, a Beech B36TC airplane, N6709Q, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Cape Yakataga, Alaska. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe airplane departed Snowshoe Lake Airport (5AK4), Glennallen, Alaska, at 0850, destined for Ketchikan, Alaska. A review of preliminary air traffic control (ATC) communications from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B) data, revealed that radar contact and radio communications were intermittent along the route of flight due to high terrain.&#x0D;\nAbout 0915 the pilot stated he was currently in visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, at an altitude of 12,500 ft mean sea level (msl). The Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) controller asked the pilot if he could climb higher, and the pilot acknowledged that he would climb to 13,500 ft msl.&#x0D;\nAbout 0920, the controller confirmed radar contact with N6709Q. The controller asked what the pilot’s requested final altitude was, the pilot replied 13,000 ft, and that he knew he had some weather ahead of him. The controller responded that he had weather and higher terrain, and that he would need to climb higher. The pilot responded that they had oxygen onboard and that the airplane was turbocharged, and that a climb to a higher altitude would not be a problem.&#x0D;\nAt 0922, the controller instructed the pilot to climb to 14,000 ft, and the pilot subsequently confirmed that he would start a climb to an assigned altitude of 14,000 ft.&#x0D;\nAt 0926, the controller told the pilot he would lose him on frequency and issued multiple backup frequencies to maintain radio communication.&#x0D;\nAt 0928, the pilot established radio communications on the new frequency. The controller told him he would lose him on all frequencies for about 10 minutes, issued the altimeter setting, and frequency to monitor.&#x0D;\nAt 0938, the controller instructed the pilot to turn 20° to the right to avoid higher terrain along the route of flight, but there was no response from the pilot.&#x0D;\nAt 0945, the controller asked another airplane to relay instructions to the pilot of N6709Q, stating, in part, to make a 20° right turn, vectors for a higher terrain.&#x0D;\nAt 0945, the pilot of the other airplane relayed a message to the controller that N6709Q had acknowledged the updated instructions.&#x0D;\nAt 0953, after reestablishing radio contact with the controller, the pilot of N6709Q requested a climb to 15,000 ft and the controller approved the request. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0958, the controller states “N6709Q, Anchorage center”, then again, “N6709Q, Anchorage center”, with no response from the pilot. The controller asks another airplane to broadcast on frequency and ask N6709Q what their intentions are.&#x0D;\nAt 0958, the controller states, “All other aircraft standby real quick, N6709Q, Anchorage center, you up? N6709Q, I see you rapidly descending at 11,000.”&#x0D;\nThere were no further communications from the pilot of N6709Q. &#x0D;\nAccording to archived FAA ADS-B data, at 0957 the airplane reached its highest altitude of 14,950 ft, then it began a left turn and rapid descent. At 0959, the final radar target was near the accident site at 8,875 ft, and 138 knots groundspeed. &#x0D;\nOn August 28, the crew of a U.S. Coast Guard HC-130 airplane located the wreckage site near Mt. Leeper located in the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, at an elevation of about 4,787 ft, but terrain and continued poor weather conditions precluded reaching the site (see figure 1).  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 Aerial image of the accident site, with red box depicting area of accident site. (Alaska Rescue Coordination Center Photo)&#x0D;\nOn September 5, weather conditions improved briefly, and a National Park Service (NPS) ranger was able to fly over and photograph the accident site. The fragmented airplane wreckage came to rest in a highly crevassed area on the Yahtse Glacier that continually accumulates snow (see figure 2). A sizable portion of the airplane wreckage was found in a large snow crater on the snow and ice-covered glacial terrain, with smaller portions of airplane wreckage observed adjacent to the crater.  &#x0D;\nOn September 13, the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve mountaineering team determined that due to the location, crevasse danger, and poor weather conditions, recovery of the airplane’s two occupants or wreckage is not possible. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 Aerial view of the accident site (National Park Service photo)&#x0D;\nThere were no airports that issued official Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METARs) within 100 miles of the accident site. An FAA weather camera was located about 18 miles southwest of the accident site at Yakataga Airport (0AA1), Yakataga, Alaska. The northwest and east weather camera images were documented to define the sky conditions near the time of the accident (see figure 3). No cameras faced the direction of the accident location. The FAA weather camera imagery surrounding the period depicted low nimbostratus type clouds which obscured the higher terrain immediately surrounding the area, with visibility less than 3 miles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3 Weather camera images depicting the clouds near the time of the accident.&#x0D;\nA broken layer of nimbostratus type clouds at 1,600 ft agl and overcast at 3,400 ft, with tops above 22,000 ft, which supported rain at the surface. The freezing level was identified at 12,280 ft and the sounding depicted favorable conditions for light-to-moderate rime type icing from the freezing level through about 24,000 ft.&#x0D;\nThe graphic forecast for aviation ceiling and visibility, and cloud forecast images depicted marginal VFR to instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions and light rain existing over the route of flight.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot reported that, during a cross-country flight, he chose to divert to a closer airport due to weather and air traffic control delays. About 40 nautical miles from the diversion airport, the engine lost total power. The pilot attempted to restart the engine, but was unsuccessful in restoring power and chose to conduct a forced landing into trees. The airplane impacted the trees and sustained substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and the left horizontal stabilizer.&#x0D;\nA video recorded by a witness near the accident site captured the sound of the engine cutting in and out before ultimately going silent, which was consistent with an additional witness report.&#x0D;\nBased upon fueling records and the pilot’s report of his fuel planning and the airplane’s fuel consumption rate, the airplane should have had about one hour of fuel remaining at the time of the loss of power. Due to the airplane damage, the total fuel quantity on board could not be established; however, the smell of fuel was present at the accident site.   &#x0D;\nExamination of the engine found that a small piece of the intake duct work of a cylinder was missing. While having this piece missing could have resulted in under-performance of the engine or a partial loss of power, it is unlikely this would have resulted in a total loss of engine power. There were no other preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures found with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation and the reason for the loss of power could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On August 26, 2023, at 1738 eastern daylight time, a Nanchang CJ-6A, N114DZ, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Merrickville, New York. The airline transport pilot and pilot-rated passenger sustained serious injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe airplane departed Dewitt Field/Old Town Municipal Airport (OLD), Old Town, Maine, at 1518 with a destination of State College Regional Airport (UNV), State College, Pennsylvania, which was about 473 miles southwest. While enroute, the pilot realized that due to weather and air traffic control (ATC) deviations, he would not have the required fuel reserves to continue the flight to UNV. He decided to divert to Greater Binghamton Airport/Edwin A Link Field (BGM), Binghamton, New York, which was 117 nautical miles northeast of UNV. Subsequently, about 40 nautical miles from BGM, the engine sustained a total loss of power.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported completing the engine failure in flight emergency procedure. He reported that the airplane had about 1 hour of fuel remaining on board at the time of the loss of power. He switched the magneto from right to left multiple times and both were only effective for a few seconds each before the engine lost power again. The pilot-rated passenger reported that, while the pilot began to address the engine failure, he called ATC and declared an emergency. ATC gave the pilot a radar vector to the closest airport, but the pilot determined that they would not be able to glide that distance and began to look for a place to make a forced landing. With no suitable fields in the vicinity, the pilot reported that, “I felt the safest course of action was to ditch into trees.” The airplane impacted multiple trees and came to rest on its right side. The impact resulted in substantial damage to both wings, the fuselage, and left horizontal stabilizer. &#x0D;\nA witness who lived near the accident site was outside her home when she saw a “small green airplane descending.” She stated that, “There was no sound whatsoever coming from the plane, he quickly lost altitude and descended into the tree line.” She also reported that, about 200 yards from the accident site, there was a “slight smell of fuel,” which she followed to find the site. A video was recorded by another witness near the accident site that recorded the sound of the airplane’s engine cutting in and out before ultimately going silent. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the wreckage found that the flight control stick moved freely by hand with no binding. The throttle control was full open, the mixture control was 3/4 toward the full rich position, the carburetor heat was on, and the fuel selector was on. There were no residual fuel vapors in either of the wing fuel tanks; however, the smell of fuel was present at the site. The front spark plugs were removed and about 2 quarts of fuel ran out of the spark plug hole of one cylinder. Compression and suction were confirmed on all cylinders when the crankshaft was rotated by hand using the propeller. Valvetrain continuity was confirmed on all but one cylinder, which exhibited impact damage to the push rods, when the crankshaft was rotated by hand using the propeller. Both magnetos were removed and produced spark on all leads when rotated using an electric drill. The fuel screen was removed and exhibited no debris; there was slight corrosion inside the fuel screen housing. The oil filter was removed and cut open; the filter pleats contained a small number of metallic fragments. The cylinders were not labeled and were marked arbitrarily; there was a hole on the No. 1 cylinder intake tube with a piece missing; this piece was not found during the examination.  &#x0D;\nReview of maintenance records indicated that the airplane’s fuel capacity was increased in 2014 to 64 gallons total, with 2 gallons of unusable fuel. The pilot reported that they had departed on the flight with 62 gallons of 100 low-lead (100LL) aviation fuel on board. Fuel records showed that the pilot purchased 28.9 gallons of 100LL two days before the accident flight. The pilot reported that he used a fuel consumption rate of 16 gallons per hour while flight planning and that he did not operate the airplane for more than 3 hours. This would result in the airplane having an endurance of about 3.8 hours; the accident occurred about 2.6 hours into the flight. -",
